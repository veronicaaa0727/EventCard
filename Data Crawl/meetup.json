Total amount divided by number of riders = your cost.</p> <p><b>RIDE SUMMARY:</p> <p>\n\n</b>The Mid-Mountain Trail is a classic ride that everyone from strong intermediates to experts will enjoy. It will just take the intermediates the better part of a day. The climb up Spiro or Armstrong is a dichotomy of long and pleasant (with Spiro being the steeper of the two,) and the cross-mountain trip, while lengthy, is just pure fun. (An alternate route involves a shuttle to a starting point at Deer Valley which skips the big climb but the total length stays almost exactly the same.)</p> <p>Part of the pleasantry comes from the scenery, and one of the highlights is that virtually the whole ride is through thick aspen groves. In the summer, the shade is welcome, and in the fall you feel like you\u2019re riding through a fast changing kaleidoscope.&lt;a href=\"http://www.jans.com/mountain-bike-tour-mid-mountain-epic#\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><img src=\"http://images.brandretailers.com/jans/assets/users/65239/files/images/trail-map-mid-mountain-epic.jpg\" /></p> <p><b>DESCRIPTION:</p> <p>\n\n</b>The ride starts with an unrelenting 3.3 mile climb that takes you from 6900\u2019 up to 8136\u2019. \u00a0This is a long ride with a big climb at the start and you need to be in pretty good shape.\u00a0 It\u2019s not recommended for your first day at altitude.\u00a0 There are countless switchbacks along the way, which a solid intermediate can handle.\u00a0</p> <p><b>We will use this starting point:</b> (Using the alternate starting point in Deer Valley means a climb of only about 300\u2019 and an extra 6 miles of Epic cross-mountain riding.)</p> <p>After the climb there\u2019s a pretty substantial section of rock garden which requires some intrepid riding or some patience walking, but the rest of the ride is not particularly technical, and the pay-off is more than worth it.\u00a0 After working up a sweat, you are rewarded with more than 15 miles of great cross mountain single track with rolling elevations ranging from 7800\u2019 to 8300\u2019 and views of Park City, White Pine Canyon, and Snyderville Basin. Once across the Canyons Resort, the downhill is long, fast, and fun. The ride finishes with either a road and paved bike path ride back to the shop or the White Pine shuttle can come pick you up.<a href=\"http://www.jans.com/mountain-bike-tour-mid-mountain-epic#\">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.jans.com/mountain-bike-tour-mid-mountain-epic#\"&gt;</a></p> <p><img src=\"http://images.brandretailers.com/jans/assets/users/65239/files/images/trail-chart-mid-mountain-epic.jpg\" /></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/b/4/event_229113972.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Release of Liability:</b></p> <p>\n\nBy joining this group for any event, you hereby RELEASE and DISCHARGE it's owners, principals, affiliates, presenters, organizer, assistant organizer, hosts and participants from any and all liability, claims, demands or causes of action that you now have, or may have in the future, for injuries, damages, death and/or economic loss of any kind or nature, arising in whole or in part out of the activities, advice or information contained herein.

Maybe we\u2019ve felt it in work, or in art, or in sex. The problem is that most of us spend our lives grasping for this state with no clear way to get back, maybe we fall back into our familiar patterns. Some never wake up - it\u2019s 2014 and it feels like 2012 was just yesterday. The antidote to this is total immersion \u2013 total immersion into your life, and total immersion into your relationships. And you can have it. It just takes a life or death attitude. That\u2019s what you can expect from experts Nicole Daedone and Steven Kotler. Nicole and Steven both credit orgasm and flow with saving their lives, and are now widely recognized as the top experts on how to have orgasm and flow in your life.</p> <p>This weekend is an opportunity to be on the front lines of this work. You\u2019ll be put into experiential learning where you can learn not just the theory of what it means to live a life of total immersion \u2013 you\u2019ll get both the nuts and bolts, and you\u2019ll actually be in flow and orgasm this weekend, which research has shown increases learning by 5x. Benefits Spend a weekend in flow and orgasm (not your normal vacation) Hands on experiential learning into how to reproduce flow and achieve optimal states of performance In depth training on orgasmic meditation from Nicole Daedone; learn how to elevate sex to an art and a craft Achieve 5x learning potential, accelerate your path to mastery.</p> <p>Be among the first in the world to get expert level training in both of these arenas; take optimal living into your life and into your relationships.</p> <p><b>Faculty</b></p> <p>Nicole Daedone is the author of Slow Sex: The Art and Craft of the Female Orgasm (Grand Central/Hachette, May 2011) and is the founder of OneTaste, a company that offers training in orgasm, sex, and man-woman relating through online media and in-person coaching and courses.

In this talk, Vlad will present a theory that unifies autoboxing, value classes, specialization and staging in a single transformation mechanism. This theory has been successfully used to implement three program transformations: miniboxing specialization (<a href=\"http://scala-miniboxing.org/\">scala-miniboxing.org</a>), multi-parameter value classes (<a href=\"http://github.com/miniboxing/value-plugin/wiki\">github.com/miniboxing/value-plugin/wiki</a>) and staging (<a href=\"http://github.com/miniboxing/staging-plugin/wiki\">github.com/miniboxing/staging-plugin/wiki</a>).</p> <p>The aim of all these transformations is to replace the data representation of certain objects in the program without altering the semantics. For example, we may want to unbox \u201cscala.Int\u201d to Java\u2019s more efficient \u201cint\u201d representation whenever possible, to avoid the overhead of heap objects. However, unboxing even a single method parameter requires adapting all its callers plus the method\u2019s body. This makes it very hard to transform a program without introducing inconsistencies.</p> <p>Yet, tracking the data representation in the type allows us to add coercions between representations in an automatic, reliable and optimal way. This mechanism can later be customized to unbox primitive types, inline value classes, to perform specialization, to optimize closures or to allow multi-stage programming, which peels away the abstraction layers slowing down high-level code. Now, the question is: what\u2019s YOUR use case for the transformation mechanism?</p> <p>&lt;b style=\"font-size : 16px\"&gt;Speaker's short bio.</b></p> <p>Vlad is a PhD student in the Scala Lab at EPFL, where he's working on optimizing high-level patterns in the Scala programming language down to fast JVM bytecode. His main project, miniboxing (<a href=\"http://scala-miniboxing.org/\">scala-miniboxing.org</a>), is aimed at compiling generic classes down to very efficient bytecode.&lt;b style=\"font-size : 16px\"&gt;<br/></b></p> <p>\n\n<b>Schedule</b></p> <p>\u2022 6:30-7:00 - networking</p> <p>\u2022 7:00-7:10 - announcements etc</p> <p>\u2022 7:10-~8:40 - talk</p> <p>\u2022 8:40-9:00 - networking</p>", "created": 1405569357000, "rsvp_limit": 200, "venue": {"city": "Mountain View", "name": "LinkedIn", "zip": "94043", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.077848, "state": "CA", "address_1": "2027 Stierlin Ct.", "country": "us", "lat": 37.423309, "id": 1214988}, "updated": 1405632869000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 71, "time": 1406944800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "195410302", "name": "What do autoboxing, value classes and specialization have in common?"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 13.93195629119873, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Doggy-Meet-ups-at-Zoom-Room-Campbell/events/194419042/", "group": {"name": "Doggy Meet-ups at Zoom Room Campbell!", "group_lat": 37.279998779296875, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Zoomers", "group_lon": -121.95999908447266, "urlname": "Doggy-Meet-ups-at-Zoom-Room-Campbell", "id": 13928252}, "description": "<p>Does your Large Dog need time to run and play with other dogs? \u00a0Come join us for our Large Dog \u00a0Meetup! \u00a0This is for social and friendly dogs that are larger size (50lbs and over).</p> <p>This event is limited to 10 dogs on a first come, first served basis, so sign up in advance!

Any one of the Detroit-raised artist's DJ sets or productions breeds a rare feel of mystique and discovery. \"I'm really obsessed with finding a line between things - between sounds and between genres. My influences come from a life spent in very different environments, which plays a huge role in the way I connect with music.\"</p> <p>Dramatic sounds and eccentric basslines carry her multilayered sound, which veers everywhere from funked-out space disco to the intricately-programmed, metallic feel of Detroit to stripped down techno, all the way to Italian horror film soundtracks. The only thing that remains consistent is the element of surprise.</p> <p>Her accidental entry into Detroit's underground party scene as a teenager was the kick-start she needed for a lifelong love affair. Soon all became a blur of \"cities, record stores, and parties.\" In 1998, she joined Minus and began touring the world as Richie Hawtin's sole opener. From there, her distinctive sound began to develop and the rest is history.</p> <p>Stylistically, Magda grooves through opposition - creating sets that are emotion-led yet clinical, having profound expertise with analog and digital technology. Her sound is otherworldly but visceral; dark with a warm sense of beauty and grace; sparse yet wondrously full-bodied with density and bass-swathed extremes. Magda's DJing style has been encapsulated on her mixed CDs 'She's A Dancing Machine,' and her mix for London club Fabric 'Fabric 49' (a mix CD with as much artistry and vision as an original album).</p> <p>In the fall of 2010, Magda revealed her debut, 'From The Fallen Page,' a darkly- tinged, transportive album that curiously combines natural, organic sounds, and modern electronic grace. Similar to her unpredictable DJ sets, 'From The Fallen Page' took listeners from one end of the spectrum to the other, treading the fine lines of extremities along the way.</p> <p>These days Magda isn't home very often. In-between touring, she's fully focused on her recently resurrected label 'Items &amp; Things.' The label's vision always pinpoints the off-kilter and the uncommon, seeking out new artists and sounds that push boundaries. \"Items and things are bits and pieces of uniqueness we come across. The label is a platform to launch the music that we love. There are no rules, just sounds we like and artists we believe in.\"</p> <p>VINCENZO BIO:</p> <p>An artist who has such talent, style and longevity is a rare creature nowadays... and Italo\u2010German Vincenzo Ragone, known to the House world as Vincenzo, is indeed one of these special creatures! Hard to track down and often a man of the night, Ragone has been casting his deep and truly one\u2010of\u2010a\u2010kind takes on House and Techno out into the ether for well over a decade. Vincenzo was a true child of the Acid House explosion, and one of an original cast of Hamburg based Djs and Producers, hanging out and collaborating with friends who would later become some of the trend setting icons of the present \u2010 notably Poker Flat's future ringmaster Steve Bug offered him some crucial gigs at the revered 'Reduced' parties at Hamburg's 'Front' Club! From here on the star in the making went on to produce his first ever productions for the Raw Elements label, alongside Sandro Catallo in 1995, and then released his first ever solo tracks with the label in '97. His production energies began to draw him further and further into this magical music, which knew no bounds, and in 1998 Vincenzo released his debut album, the classic '1\u2010800\u2010Vincenzo,' on none other than the newly blossoming Dessous Imprint to great International applause. Numerous solo and collaborative releases followed, notching up studio time in New York with Alexi Delano (aka A.D.N.Y), leading to the A.D.N.Y &amp; Vincenzo project. Clearly picking up a heavy dose of those soulful, US House flavours that would never wash away... His year spent living in New York proved Vincenzo had real International appeal, and increased touring to play gigs in House Clubs stateside, as well as globally, confirmed this musical passion was meant to be. His relationship with the funky yet stripped, Deep House movement continued through his enigmatic 'Strip Joint Grooves' series on Dessous, and also through further collaborations with San Francisco's Dj Rasoul, Nottingham's John Buckby aka Schmoov, Marc Schneider (aka Snider) and many, many more. Indeed his name and musical offerings continued to elevate and inspire, and recent releases and remixes on Dessous and Hamburg's Liebe*Detail records suggested a more mature, techy sound had sprouted from the seasoned house\u2010head's mixing desk. 2007's notable remix for the Liebe*Detail offshoot label 'Spezial', a stunning re\u2010think of a Move\u2010D modern classic, 'Anne Will', won him notoriety for effortlessly transcending both the Deep House and Minimal Techno worlds.... creating a reduced beach party track that also had the power to deeply rock the clubs! Vincenzo racked\u2010up a serious amount of air miles over his long and busy career (and he continues to do so!) He has worked with some of the most important producers and labels within his field of expertise, yet he maintains a humble existence, not wanting to over \u2010play his part in the grand scheme of things. In fact, he shouldn't be so humble, as his records, both old and new, are consistently played and charted by a spectrum of Djs that most producers could only dream of... No surprise then that his most recent EP \u0301s for Pokerflat,Freerange and his own new imprint Teardrop picked up big support from steve bug,laurent garnier,josh wink,ian pooley and sasse.only to name a few: proof once more that this traditionally\u2010underground impresario of House is here to stay, and continues to share his unique sound with the world.</p>", "created": 1405369973000, "venue": {"city": "San Francisco", "name": "Public Works", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.419418, "state": "CA", "address_1": "161 Erie Street Street", "country": "us", "lat": 37.774929, "id": 13517022}, "updated": 1405369973000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 5, "time": 1406955600000, "duration": 21600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "194902972", "name": "Magda, Vincenzo @ Public Works"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 45.59041213989258, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/hammerinwheels/events/135111252/", "group": {"name": "The Hammerin' Wheels Road Bike Club", "group_lat": 38.77000045776367, "join_mode": "approval", "who": "Road Bikers", "group_lon": -121.29000091552734, "urlname": "hammerinwheels", "id": 286136}, "description": "<p>The Marin Cyclists are looking forward to presenting the best cycling event in NorCal.\u00a0 We once again are expecting to sell out. \u00a0Don't miss this summertime classic.\u00a0 Register early!</p> <p>The Marin Century is proud to give back to the community.\u00a0 The proceeds from this event help support Senior Services, Sports groups, Youth and Community organizations and Health Advocacy organizations in the Marin and surrounding Bay Area</p> <p><b>When registering make sure you pick Hammerin' Wheels as your club!!</b></p> <p>More info along with link to online registration can be found here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.marincyclists.com/marincentury.com\"><a href=\"http://www.marincyclists.com/marincentury.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.marincyclists.com/marincentury.com</a></a></p>", "created": 1376676028000, "venue": {"city": "San Rafael", "name": "Vallecito School", "zip": "94903", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.550226, "state": "CA", "address_1": "50 Nova Albion Way", "country": "us", "lat": 38.006359, "id": 1321593}, "updated": 1392247893000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 5, "time": 1406984400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "135111252", "name": "52nd Marin Century & Mt.

We are now accepting applications through the Summit website: <a href=\"http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com\">www.effectivealtruismsummit.com</a></p> <p>Effective altruism is a growing intellectual movement that uses evidence and reason to identify the most effective ways of improving the world. This approach often involves reframing the problem in order to get at less conventional and less obvious solutions. For example, if you want to improve the lives of the poor, society tells you to do something like join the Peace Corps. But in fact it may be more effective to work on Wall Street for two years, earn hundreds of thousands of dollars, and give most of it to a charity proven to save lives.</p> <p>The Summit is largest annual gathering of the effective altruism movement. This year\u2019s conference will be in two parts: a 5-day retreat for committed effective altruists looking to hone their strategy skills and make connections with like-minded people, and a 2-day conference for anyone interested in learning more about effective altruism and being part of the largest annual gathering of the community. The weekend conference will be a mixture of presentations, interactive workshops and social time. Speakers include:<br/>\u00a0\nPeter Thiel, Thiel Foundation, co-founder of PayPal<br/>Holden Karnofsky, co-founder of Givewell<br/>Max Tegmark, co-founder of the Future of Life Institute, professor at MIT<br/>\u00a0</p> <p>Members of the following organizations will be in attendance: Machine Intelligence Research Institute; GiveWell; Centre for Effective Altruism; 80,000 Hours; Giving What We Can Center for Applied Rationality &amp; Leverage Research.</p> <p>You should apply if:<br/>you want to be part of the largest collection of people trying to improve the world in a strategic way<br/>you work at an NGO or charity and feel dissatisfied with the size of your impact<br/>you want to improve the world and feel discouraged by the current options<br/>you\u2019re willing to look beyond simplistic solutions to figure out how the world really works<br/>you want to apply more rigorous methods of evaluation to your current projects<br/>you want to know how to select your next project</p> <p>Financial aid is available.

If you stay for lunch, I think their hamburger is one of the best in the area.\u00a0</p> <p>The place is popular, \u00a0but they have more space at the new location so I will expand the limit to 20, and we can test how that goes.\u00a0</p> <p>The new Location is approximately a block from the Iron Horse Trails for those of you interested in hiking/biking before or after.\u00a0</p> <p>The format for Coffee is the same. Come when you please and leave when you please, making this a good on the way spot if you are driving up or down 680 that day, or live close to Danville. For the rest of us, this is a great place to start our day.

Rose to\u00a0Marlette Lake via the Flume Trail:</b></p> <p><b>950 feet of climbing. 20 miles</b></p> <p><b>Pack a lunch! We will eat at Marlette Lake.</b></p> <p>The beginning of this beautiful section of the Tahoe Rim Trail is at 8700' above the Sheep Flats (aka Tahoe Meadows) on the Mt. Rose Highway above Incline Village.</p> <p><br/>It is often quite cool in the morning at the shuttle drop off site so bring a wind shell to start the ride. The first part of the trail parallels the highway and then descends through the meadows and briefly joins the Ophir Creek trail.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/b/4/event_229113972.jpeg\" /></p> <p>After a 300' climb out of the meadows (the biggest climb until you reach the Tunnel Creek road) you begin to contour your way to the Tunnel Creek road. There are many great vistas of Lake Tahoe as well as Washoe Lake in Nevada. The contrast between the Tahoe basin and the Great basin is startling. There are many small climbs and descents along the route toward the Tunnel Creek road in the Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park. This section is moderately technical due to the many solo rock steps. Lofting your front wheel over the steps is a very useful skill to have in your quiver.</p> <p><b>At about nine miles,</b> you will come to the Tunnel Creek Road (8000'). Down this road to the right a half a mile brings you to the North end of the Flume Trail. The views on the Flume trail\u00a0are awesome. It is truly one of the best trails to get views of Lake Tahoe.</p> <p>As\u00a0you ride the Flume Trail it will take\u00a0you past Marlette Lake.\u00a0The ride will then head back along the Flume Trail to Tunnel Creek Road. Yes,\u00a0you will be doing the Flume Trail twice. At the intersection at Tunnel Creek Road, it will be truly all downhill back to the cafe parking area. The road down is very sandy in places so watch your speed.\u00a0Please smile and say hi to all trail users.</p> <p><a href=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/a/2/highres_138021922.jpeg\">&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/a/2/highres_138021922.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/a/2/highres_138021922.jpeg\">&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/a/2/highres_138021922.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;<img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/a/2/600_138021922.jpeg\" /></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theflumetrail.com/\"><a href=\"http://www.theflumetrail.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.theflumetrail.com/</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Shuttle Fee:\u00a0$15</b></p> <p><b>Directions:</b></p> <p>From South Lake Tahoe and the casino district, after the casino district continue north on US 50 about 12 miles to the junction of State Route 28.

Billy has extensive experience in capturing the beauty and complexity of the female human form. \"My photographs can be placed in two general categories: those images which I make in the studio are studies in lighting, contrast and geometry; whereas the images made in the natural environment are an attempt to fuse landscape photography with figure art\".

Failure to pre-purchase will move you to \"not attending\" status.</p> <p>THE CAMPGROUND. I have reserved walk-in camp spots # 11 and #12 for us. Near a bathroom, but with a bit of privacy. Each spot has a BBQ pit and a picnic table. DOGS MUST BE ON LEASH, and can not be left unattended in the car or tied up outside.</p> <p>MEALS- We'll figure out the logistics/menu later, but we can plan on Saturday lunch (picnic), Saturday dinner (early BBQ, plus the theatre has a concession stand with coffee, tea, wine, soft drinks, chips and candy), and Sunday breakfast. We'll stop for supplies in Saratoga and split the cost.</p> <p>We'll also figure out who is rooming with whom once we get a little closer. Tent-mates will be same gender. If you'd rather not risk having an unknown tent-mate, one option is to reserve an adjoining campsite for yourself. Choose site #13 or #14 and make a note of it in \"comments\" so we know to add the extra headcount.</p> <p>When you sign up, please let us know the following<br/>--Do you have a tent? the larger the better, as it will have to hold people and dogs.<br/>--What other camping/storage equipment can you bring?<br/>---We will have to car pool. Is your car large enough to take on passenger (plus dog, plus equipment). If not, please let us know that you will be a passenger and not a driver.</p> <p>This should be a fun evening, and I think we'll all be dog-tired once we get home</p>", "created": 1393914603000, "rsvp_limit": 10, "venue": {"city": "Saratoga", "name": "Sanborn County Park", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.023018, "state": "CA", "address_1": "16055 Sanborn Rd", "country": "us", "lat": 37.263832, "id": 12480962}, "updated": 1405666183000, "visibility": "public", "id": "169306072", "yes_rsvp_count": 10, "time": 1407006000000, "duration": 90000000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "how_to_find_us": "We'll meet in San Francisco and drive down together.", "name": "OVERNIGHT  Theatre and camping trip to Saratoga"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 15.76378345489502, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Santa-Cruz-Craft-Beer/events/188154912/", "group": {"name": "CRUZ BEER (cruzbeer.com)", "group_lat": 36.9900016784668, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Craft Beer Drinkers", "group_lon": -122.05999755859375, "urlname": "Santa-Cruz-Craft-Beer", "id": 1795976}, "description": "<p>Silicon Valley Beer Week\u2019s capstone event, the Summer KraftBrew Fest 2014, wraps up the week\u2019s festivities with an open-air festival at Gordon Biersch Brewery in downtown San Jose.</p> <p>Summer KraftBrew Fest 2014 features an exciting selection of craft brews, live music, and a speakers series on craft beer topics.

You don't have to. Remember, someone will wait for you at turns, so just relax and have fun.<br/>~ I maintain the Pace according to road conditions with safety of all riders in mind. Be mindful of others in the group. Let faster riders get ahead of you by moving to the right and signaling them to pass you. And if you want to pass the rider(s) who are in front of you, make sure to do so safely and without startling them.<br/>~ If you know the area and would like to sweep for the group please let me know.<br/>~ Good stuff to read before going on group rides (<a href=\"http://www.groupridesforum.net/messages/boards/thread/9266605\">CLICK</a>).<br/>~ Keep an eye for the rider(s) behind you so they won't take a wrong turn. If they get lost, you'll buy their dinner<br/>~ City riding means traffic lights, stop signs and of course other vehicles.\u00a0 Below is an exaggerated case, but it illustrates that getting separated doesn't mean getting lost. BLUE dots are riders going\u00a0from A to G points of a route. RED dots are the\u00a0riders\u00a0who have stopped and are waiting for the rider behind them.\u00a0 When stopping at a turn for\u00a0a rider who\u00a0is behind you, wait \"before\" the turn so they see you.\u00a0\u00a0Not \"after\" or \"in\" the turn, because by the time they realize you have turned, they have\u00a0missed the turn, or they may not even see you at all.\u00a0 If you approach a rider who is waiting for you, but you don't see the rider behind you, please stop at the same stop so the one waiting can go while you wait for the rest to arrive.\u00a0REMEMBER, WE ALL WAIT .... ALL EXCEPT THE SWEEP SINCE HE IS THE LAST ONE</p> <p><img src=\"http://img1.meetupstatic.com/816470374029094449829953/img/smileys/devilish.gif\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y73/Motopars/SF3.jpg\" /></p> <p>Frequent Pauses:</p> <p>As you can see, we'll have a large size group (20+ bikes).

Cool... keep reading.\u00a0</b>\u00a0</p> <p>Basic structure: A large and beautiful sacred space for free-form dancing to amazing music in a loving community environment.\u00a0</p> <p>* Be moved by Live DJ with Live Drumming and Improvisational music too!\u00a0</p> <p>* Bring your heart-felt intention and dance it into being. You are welcome to bring a token to represent your intention if you so desire, and place it on the Community Altar as we journey together.</p> <p>* Areas are set up for meditation, energy/body work, and community networking. Healthy snacks, tea and water are provided.\u00a0We invite volunteer Reiki healers and other energy/body workers to attend the healing areas.</p> <p>* Yoga Mats / Back Jacks / Chairs available. Feel free to bring your own yoga mats for stretching or lying down.</p> <p>*\u00a0All ages welcome! Young children should be supervised by parents/guardians.</p> <p>* New-comers welcome and encouraged!<br/>If this is your first Dance with us, we strongly encourage you to arrive by no later than 8:00 p.m. sharp for a helpful and brief orientation. \u00a0This really helps to get everyone clear about how we can participate fully and have the best time possible at our dance.</p> <p><br/><b>* Important Guidelines and Tips *\u00a0</b></p> <p>1. We kindly ask for a Talk-Free dance floor.<br/>This allows for people to go deeper into their Dance and connect with their journey through the Elements. (Chat and conversation is welcome in the tea room, outside, or very quietly just off the dance floor in the \"Chill out zone\".)\u00a0</p> <p>2. Dance however you want. There is no right or wrong way. Listen to your body and move to the way it feels. Express who you are from the inside out.\u00a0</p> <p>3. Respect yourself as well as those around you. Pay attention to your boundaries and the boundaries of others. Communicate through eye contact and body language. Be compassionate and aware. If it becomes necessary to use your words, please feel free to do so in a respectful way.<br/>Many participants find meaningful interactions on the dance floor which both surprise and delight.</p> <p>4. Bring extra water - Mainly recommended for those who get very thirsty while exercising, or have a cold.\u00a0</p> <p>5. Wear clothes that make you feel good and are comfortable for dancing. Be expressive and colorful if you like, or just show up in your sweats. It's all good! Dancing barefoot or in socks is fine. Shoes are ok, but heavy tread shoes or heals are not allowed. Most dance shoes or slippers are great.\u00a0</p> <p>6. We are a clean and sober venue. \u00a0No drugs or alcohol, period.</p> <p>7. Please, do not bring cameras to the event. \u00a0Personal photo/video without express permission (from subjects and the organizers alike) is not allowed.<br/>This guideline is for everyone's assurance of privacy and feeling of safety.</p> <p>8. ALL ages and genders are welcome.\u00a0</p> <p>9. Be yourself!\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>* Even MORE about the Dance *\u00a0</b>\u00a0<br/>~ IF YOU HAVE NEVER ATTENDED BEFORE... Please take a few minutes to read the rest. ~</p> <p>We welcome all to the Dance. \u00a0Open your heart, and dissolve any blocks of judgment and fear. \u00a0Come, move your body and soul to a handpicked mix of music: inspirational, uplifting, world beat, tribal, funk, pop, electronica, trance, ambient and much more. \u00a0Live improvisational music and inspired guided meditations set to music are often part of the evening to transition us from element to element, focusing intention as we journey together through the experience.</p> <p>As we dance, we can reintegrate and refuel ourselves through communion with the Elements of Air, Fire, Water, and Earth, naturally leading us back to the center of our being. \u00a0Each Element can be treated as an initiation into a spiritual journey, each one having a unique resonance within us. This practice is designed to propel us towards greater integration between our bodies and higher consciousness, as well as our community.<br/>As a community, we recognize that we can learn and grow by witnessing and supporting one another through our shared expressions of each elemental energy. \u00a0Let's work those edges together, and return ourselves to a life of deep trusting.<br/>Rediscover and liberate your heart of hearts together through dance!</p> <p><br/><b>* What to expect when you arrive *\u00a0</b></p> <p>Arrive to soft music. Check in first, and then quietly find a place for your things. You may choose to be welcomed with a cleansing/smudge (smoke-free mist). Relax, breathe and stretch as others arrive.\u00a0</p> <p>We will be called together for a welcoming circle, speaking of our names, brief orientation, and grounding meditation. Then the dancing starts.\u00a0</p> <p>There are several \"stations\" throughout the venue to help you with being present during the Dance.\u00a0</p> <p>1. Drumming:\u00a0<br/>There are an assortment of drums/shakers available for you to play. You may borrow available instruments or bring your own. (Remember to remove rings/bracelets.) Please attend children. The goal is to support the dancers by adding to the energy of the music. Sensitivity and awareness is key to holding the energy in the room...<br/>If you are new to drumming, please ask for guidance. \u00a0We are happy to provide this as a growth opportunity and chance to try this form of expression in alignment with the Dance. \u00a0[DevaGnosis also holds monthly Drum Circles for further exploration.]</p> <p>2. \"Tea\" Room:\u00a0<br/>Need a refresher? We have a lovely table with healthy snacks to help re-energize and 'ground' you. \u00a0A great place to chat as well.\u00a0</p> <p>3. Chill out zone:\u00a0<br/>Need to be still for awhile? This is a cozy space set aside for meditation/stillness.\u00a0</p> <p>4. Healing:\u00a0<br/>Feeling tapped? Reiki Practitioners and experienced Energy and Body Workers from within our community are often available to offer their care to re-energize and align the participants.\u00a0\u00a0LGAQ has a few private offices set up for our use during the evening.<br/>If you are a practitioner willing to offer service, please contact an organizer for further details. \u00a0(What a great way to highlight your personal practice.)</p> <p>5. Community Altar:\u00a0<br/>This is a space for you to focus your energy and intention or to draw inspiration from during the dance. You may bring something to place on or near the altar if you feel called to do so.\u00a0</p> <p>6. Community networking area:\u00a0<br/>This surface is set up near the entrance so that we can get to know one another better. Bring your business cards and brochures, event flyers, freebies, etc.\u00a0<br/>Please take a moment to look through the materials during the evening and collect anything of interest. Seek and ye shall find.\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>* Closing Process*\u00a0</b></p> <p>At the end of the night, we usually end with a simple Heart Sharing with a few words spoken by those who wish to speak about what they experienced and any gratitudes, etc. There is also time allowed for community announcements before we part.</p> <p>Remember, you are free to bring flyers for your events/services and put them on the community networking table as well.\u00a0</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://devagnosis.eventbrite.com/\"><a href=\"http://devagnosis.eventbrite.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://devagnosis.eventbrite.com/</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\"Dance Elemental\" TM - DevaGnosis 2008</p> <p>************<br/>Dakini's cell: [masked]<br/>Tymn's cell: [masked]</p>", "created": 1386446051000, "rsvp_limit": 50, "venue": {"city": "Los Gatos", "name": "Los Gatos Acupuncture and Qigong Center", "zip": "95032", "repinned": false, "lon": -121.9748, "state": "CA", "address_1": "761 University Ave., Ste A", "country": "us", "lat": 37.238857, "id": 5451902}, "updated": 1393225146000, "visibility": "public", "id": "qtlrghyslbdb", "yes_rsvp_count": 4, "time": 1407034800000, "duration": 10800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "how_to_find_us": "There is street parking as well as parking available in the lot next to the building (where the self-storage sign is).", "name": "DANCE ELEMENTAL - Ecstatic Dance Journey"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 14.408449172973633, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/BayAreaCycling/events/188252942/", "group": {"name": "Bay Area Cycling", "group_lat": 37.75, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Cyclists", "group_lon": -122.41999816894531, "urlname": "BayAreaCycling", "id": 618694}, "description": "<p>Anyone signed up for this event?

A notepad for writing down notes is a good idea. There will be a lot of information to learn so notes will be a good idea for when you practice your knots and anchors at home.</p> <p>A folding lawn chair is welcome during the lecture portion of the class.</p> <p>All other gear will be provided.</p> <p>Classes are usually taught in a park in Alameda. Other locations can be negotiated by request for groups.</p> <p><br/>Class size: minimum 4, maximum 8 (more possible by request and at instructor's discretion)</p> <p>Time for class: this is an all-day class that usually runs 6+ hours depending on the overall learning ability of the group.

Mostly a residential community with scattered retail/commercial areas, it is bounded by the cities of Walnut Creek, Lafayette, Concord, and Martinez. Pleasant Hill has recently (2000) redeveloped its downtown to create a contemporary shopping district just blocks from the site.

The 24-mile trail goes north-south from Concord to Dublin and connects to several other trails that traverse the county making for great biking opportunities.</p> <p>A neighborhood park is located just the other side of Fair Oaks Elementary School adjacent to the site. Briones Regional Park and Mt. Diablo State Park are located nearby providing numerous opportunities for hiking and recreation.

Writing in a lyrical mixture of Spanish and English that is her unique heritage, she meditates on the condition of Chicanos in Anglo culture, women in Hispanic culture, and lesbians in the straight world. Her essays and poems range over broad territory, moving from the plight of undocumented migrant workers to memories of her grandmother, from Aztec religion to the agony of writing. Anzaldua is a rebellious and willful talent who recognizes that life on the border, \"life in the shadows,\" is vital territory for both literature and civilization. Venting her anger on all oppressors of people who are culturally or sexually different, the author has produced a powerful document that belongs in all collections with emphasis on Hispanic American or feminist issues.\"</p>", "created": 1402021040000, "rsvp_limit": 20, "venue": {"city": "Berkeley", "name": "Mudraker's Cafe", "zip": "94701", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.25918, "phone": "(510) 649-7315", "state": "CA", "address_1": "2801 Telegraph Ave", "country": "us", "lat": 37.859528, "id": 660551}, "updated": 1403387044000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 20, "time": 1407099600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "187465582", "name": "First Book Discussion: Borderlands/ La Frontera by Gloria E.

After working with Ms. Ho, one teen writer independently published her 400-page fantasy novel. Their students have gotten accepted into top colleges and universities, such as UC San Diego, Carnegie Mellon, Caltech, MIT, NYU, and Brown University. Ms. Ho has a B.A. from Pomona College and an M.A. from Lesley University. Mr. Hatta has a B.A. from the California State University at Long Beach, with specialties in history, art, theater, and philosophy.

If you'd like to meet more people than you're sitting next to, feel free to walk around and mingle with other tables. There will be people with a variety of eating styles at the event; all we ask is that everyone be respectful and kind to each other, and order a meatless dish to help the environment.</p> <p><b>More Information About Meatless Monday</b></p> <p>Our normal Meatless Monday dinners are the <i>first Monday of the month at 6:30pm</i>.

To make sure our events are a success, if you're a no-show three times you won't be able to RSVP for the dinners anymore (it's nothing personal). Emergencies or illness aside, when you cancel at the last minute, that can mean some people who wanted to go couldn't, so that might be marked as well.</p> <p><br/><i>Be sure to check in with me so we can mark you as present on the RSVP list.</i> That way I won't accidentally mark you as a no-show. Things get a little crazy as people arrive so I could easily make a mistake.</p> <p><br/>Hope to see you there! Multiple meetup groups are attending. If you'd like to meet more people than you're sitting next to, feel free to walk around and mingle with other tables.

The folks at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.urbansitter.com/\">UrbanSitter</a>\u00a0are kindly hosting and will provide pizza.

The interviewer will spend a few minutes asking the interviewee about their resume, experience and what they are looking for in a role. Then they spend 20 minutes or so posing a technical coding question, and reviewing the solution. Then, the pair switch roles.\u00a0Pairs are, of course, welcome to change it up to suit their own needs.</p> <p>After each round, we can change partners and we aim to get through 2 to 3 rounds in the evening.</p> <p>Please come prepared with:</p> <p>* A friendly and inquisitive attitude!</p> <p>* A copy of your resume for the 'interviewer' to review and discuss</p> <p>* Some 'puzzler' type questions that are typical in tech interviews; Ideally questions you know the answers to! We will provide some too.</p> <p>Feel free to bring business/contact cards too. Networking is your best tool to find that next role!</p> <p>Doors open at 5:45 and we start at 6:00.

This means that women\u2019s voices are still not heard equally in the decisions that most affect our lives. In\u00a0Lean In,\u00a0Sheryl Sandberg examines why women\u2019s progress in achieving leadership roles has stalled, explains the root causes, and offers compelling, commonsense solutions that can empower women to achieve their full potential.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>Sandberg is the chief operating officer of Facebook and is ranked onFortune\u2019s list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business and as one ofTime\u2019s 100 Most Influential People in the World. In 2010, she gave an electrifying TEDTalk in which she described how women unintentionally hold themselves back in their careers. Her talk, which became a phenomenon and has been viewed more than two million times, encouraged women to \u201csit at the table,\u201d seek challenges, take risks, and pursue their goals with gusto.</p> <p><br/>In\u00a0Lean In,\u00a0Sandberg digs deeper into these issues, combining personal anecdotes, hard data, and compelling research to cut through the layers of ambiguity and bias surrounding the lives and choices of working women. She recounts her own decisions, mistakes, and daily struggles to make the right choices for herself, her career, and her family. She provides practical advice on negotiation techniques, mentorship, and building a satisfying career, urging women to set boundaries and to abandon the myth of \u201chaving it all.\u201d\u00a0 She describes specific steps women can take to combine professional achievement with personal fulfillment and demonstrates how men can benefit by supporting women in the workplace and at home.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>Written with both humor and wisdom,\u00a0Sandberg\u2019s book is an inspiring call to action and a blueprint for individual growth.\u00a0Lean In\u00a0is destined to change the conversation from what women can\u2019t do to what they can.</p> <p><img src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1364250803l/16071764.jpg\" /></p>", "created": 1401827987000, "venue": {"city": "Walnut Creek", "name": "Hosted by Michelle", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.061623, "state": "CA", "address_1": "location TBD", "country": "us", "lat": 37.90118, "id": 20495452}, "updated": 1402345911000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 13, "time": 1407288600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "186946992", "name": "August Book Club - Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead by Sheryl Sandberg"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 32.0972900390625, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/rsi-2/events/161402592/", "group": {"name": "East Bay Repetitive Strain Injury Support Group, Berkeley,CA", "group_lat": 37.880001068115234, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Members", "group_lon": -122.26000213623047, "urlname": "rsi-2", "id": 190559}, "description": "<p><a href=\"http://files.meetup.com/190559/CIL.jpg\"><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/0/0/event_189438432.jpeg\" /></a>East Bay RSI Support Group - [masked]</p> <p>Yoga</p> <p><a href=\"http://garudahealing.com/\">Jim Stockton</a> is a lyengar yoga practitioner who incorporates restorative Yoga poses with a focus on the breath to relax and heal your body.

The Universe had me live in high-energy environments (i.e. over a former POW camp in Guam &amp; in a Berlin barracks -site of a bloody coup attempt between different factions of Nazis). I often spontaneously channeled at some length - details that couldn't be found any other apparent way. Neither of these things were explained or encouraged by Church doctrine -So I kept investigating - &amp; practicing. My studies took me more than half-way around the world, to many disciplines &amp; several renowned &amp; wise teachers, including one of Sylvia Browne's mentors, &amp; being \"adopted\" by a hereditary Kahuna while still in grade-school. I am grateful to Charlie, Kevin Reyerson, S. Bartlett, Hans King &amp; Nick Nocerino for their guidance &amp; encouragement. I also studied with the Spiritual Science Church. Every night since I was three, my mother would practice telepathy with me, using a deck of playing cards at the kitchen table. Since all the neighborhood kids' moms played Bridge, I thought everyone played the \"telepathy game\" after dinner. Boy, was I surprised! I was in my 40's when I found out there was a trick to a magic trick which was popular in my childhood; until then, I thought you picked the correct card by intuition &amp; psychometry. After doing Palmistry, I moved to doing Psychometry (reading energy off of objects -from car keys to Stonehenge stones), &amp; now do what are called \"Cold Readings\" (reading the energy of the person or events without the aid of anything else, such as Tarot, crystal balls, etc.)</p> <p>I have used my psychic &amp; remote viewing capabilities for police, the National Security Agency, Military Intelligence, and other Agencies.</p> <p>I feel strongly that intuition is a powerful tool in daily but most of us have not been guided to develop it or taught how to trust our own abilities.</p> <p>For more info: <a href=\"http://www.WhispersInTheWinds.com\">www.WhispersInTheWinds.com</a>. Our purpose is a focused gathering to share in spiritual awareness and most importantly, the awareness of your own connectedness. A safe place for practice &amp; validation of your own innate psychic &amp; metaphysical abilities. Intuition is a powerful tool in daily life &amp; as magical &amp; ordinary as any of our senses, but most of us have not been guided to develop it or taught how to trust our own abilities. In this new century, it is becoming essential for us all to live the most balanced and integrated lives possible. In Authentic and compassionate living, it is necessary to synthesize wisdom, logic &amp; feeling, as well as deepening understanding.</p> <p>For more info: <a href=\"http://www.whispersinthewinds.com/\">www.WhispersInTheWinds.com</a></p>", "created": 1395796131000, "rsvp_limit": 45, "venue": {"city": "Livermore", "name": "Livermore Civic Library", "zip": "94551", "repinned": false, "lon": -121.773312, "state": "CA", "address_1": "1188 South Livermore Ave.", "country": "us", "lat": 37.694179, "id": 868418}, "updated": 1395796131000, "visibility": "public", "id": "qpgqdjyslbhb", "yes_rsvp_count": 4, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/WhispersInTheWinds/events/189730562/", "time": 1407290400000, "duration": 7200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "how_to_find_us": "Livermore Civic Library ~ ~ Community Room A,  on the right, across from the restrooms", "name": "Tuesday Kim Kristiansson's Whispers In The Winds Psychic Classes & Meditation"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 8.791342735290527, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/philosophy-219/events/194375492/", "group": {"name": "Bay Area Russell Set Meetup Group", "group_lat": 37.439998626708984, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Philosophers", "group_lon": -122.1500015258789, "urlname": "philosophy-219", "id": 487514}, "description": "<p>This is the third essay in the collection of essays in the book, \"Why I Am Not A Christian\" by Bertrand Russell. \u00a0This collection, first published in 1957 covers a range of Russell's essays on religion and related subjects. \u00a0Please join with us to read and converse with each other on these important essays in the life and thought of Russell.\u00a0</p>", "created": 1405107129000, "venue": {"city": "Sunnyvale", "name": "Thai Pepper", "zip": "94087", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.032186, "phone": "408-739-7717", "state": "CA", "address_1": "103 E Fremont Ave", "country": "us", "lat": 37.352226, "id": 681053}, "updated": 1405107129000, "visibility": "public", "id": "194375492", "yes_rsvp_count": 3, "time": 1407290400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "how_to_find_us": "Look to the right as you enter the restaurant.

Other times teams just go through the motions, having no idea what they mean. More than a decade after the Agile Manifesto, as an industry, we are no better off. Many have never seen a good Agile project that meet its commitments or promises, and bad Agile lets people assume that because they can't do it then it can't be done. Without knowing the true cost and schedule of the project, companies cannot make educated decisions and are literally playing poker without looking at the cards. Furthermore, poor Agile lets practitioners skirt the issue of not knowing how to do system and project design, pretend design is not needed or is even bad. In this candid, somber, and entertaining session Juval will reflect on what is wrong with the common way of doing Agile, identify the fallacies and misconceptions, the consequences of bad Agile, explain why people fail to do it right, the patterns the fall into, and what you can and must do about it, to prosper and BE agile. Juval will show how combining Agile with architecture and project design yields an excellent construction process delivering on schedule and on budget every time.\u00a0</p> <p><br/><b>Note</b>: Upon arrival at Intel,\u00a0park on the 2nd level of parking garage D behind building SC12.

He is a regular round table guest on the E! late night talk show Chelsea Lately, and has been appearing on the show since January 2008.\u00a0 He is a frequent guest on KPCC (Southern California's NPR affiliate) on the Patt Morrison Program, bringing his comedic spin to political issues. He also reported for KPCC live from the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. He starred in the NBC series The Real Wedding Crashers, a prime time comedy that aired on the network Mondays at 10pm, with the show Heroes as a lead-in. The show also aired on BRAVO and STYLE Network. In 2009 he performed his standup on NBC's Last Call with Carson Daly, and in 2008, Gleib was featured on the NBC competition show Last Comic Standing. He is known for covering a wide range of topics in his act, including political and social commentary, but is also known for his improvisational skills, often making up large sections of his performance based on interactions with the crowd. A recent review of his stand up said \"His persona has evolved to a satirical high...his act is laden with material that pays every time.\u201c In 2006, he sold a pilot called The Gleib Show to Fox, produced by Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels, Broadway Video, and NBC/Universal. This show was based on a TV show that Gleib directed, wrote, and starred in for three seasons on the National Lampoon Network from 2003\u20132005, which aired to college campuses across the country, and was consistently the network's number one show. It was also written and produced by Scot Richardson. The show was based on a show of the same title that Gleib did for four years during his time as an undergrad at the University of California, San Diego. At UCSD he studied Communications and Theater, and graduated in the Honors Thesis Program. He was a commencement speaker at his graduation. Ben Gleib appears in a supporting role in the feature film Bar Starz, which had a limited theatrical release. The film also featured Charlie Murphy, Daniel Franceze, Derek Waters, John Bernthal, and Nikki Griffin. In addition, Gleib has performed on The Late Late Show on CBS, at the Vancouver Comedy Festival, the Laughing Matters Festival in the Netherlands, hosted several pods for Current TV, and in 2002 wrote the \"Radio Music Awards\" for ABC.</p> <p>If you haven't seen an \"American Me Comedy Show\" then you're definitely missing out!

What is \"orthogonal unit differentiation\" and why is it important? Meaningful choice is one of the staples of good and compelling game design, but as a concept it is still poorly understood. This talk from the Game Developers Conference in 2014 is a detailed exploration of choice in games: why it is important, how it ties into the psychological underpinnings of why we play games, and how it connects to other fundamental game design concepts like the space of possibility, motivation, player agency and the actual level design of a game.

Speaking regularly in front of a group helps you calm your nerves and communicate effectively.</p> <p><b>\u201cPractice\u201d Presentations for Other Audiences</b><br/>Everyone has different motivations for wanting to speak better. Maybe you want to hone your presentation skills for your career. Perhaps you want to be able to speak out in your volunteer organization. Maybe you want to complement your portfolio as an author, manager, or other professional with speaking gigs? Whatever the case, Toastmasters is a wonderful laboratory for you to practice your presentations and gain valuable feedback.</p> <p><b>Gain the Confidence and Courage to Lead</b><br/>Leadership and communication skills are intimately bound. Some might argue that leadership is nothing more than the ability to effectively communicate a vision. As your communication skills improve, your ability to lead will improve as well.</p> <p><b>???</b><br/>Many Six Minutes readers are Toastmasters, so I\u2019ll pass this question to you.<br/><b>Why did you join?<br/>What advice would you pass to someone considering joining?<br/></b> Let us know in the comments.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "created": 1401435543000, "venue": {"city": "San Jose", "name": "Hanhai Investment, Inc.", "zip": "95131", "repinned": false, "lon": -121.916023, "state": "CA", "address_1": "97 E Brokaw Rd (suite 210)", "country": "us", "lat": 37.375614, "id": 9249282}, "updated": 1401435543000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 23, "time": 1407437100000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "dkpxqjyslbkb", "name": "Silicon Valley Entrepreneurs Toastmasters Open Meeting"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 23.556072235107422, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/womendrummers/events/165877432/", "group": {"name": "Women Drummers International", "group_lat": 37.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "who": "drummers and dancers", "group_lon": -122.26000213623047, "urlname": "womendrummers", "id": 6003562}, "description": "<p>Join us on August 7 \u2013 10, 2014 at beautiful Bort Meadow, Anthony Chabot Regional Park, just 20 minutes from Oakland, California for a long weekend of camping, drum workshops, drum circles, shared meals, camp fires, performances, and fun for women and girls, 10 years and up.</p> <p>Please go to <a href=\"http://www.womendrummers.org/\">www.womendrummers.org</a> for the following:</p> <p>\u2022 Location, Camping and Amenities info</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Cost and Registration</p> <p>\u2022 FAQs</p> <p>\u2022 Teacher Bios</p> <p>Click on \"Born to Drum Camp 2014\".</p> <p>Advanced registration is preferred.</p> <p>Here is the schedule for the weekend:</p> <p>FRIDAY:\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a012:30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OPENING BLESSING</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01:00 \u2013 2:30:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LARISSA MONTFORT, West Africa</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NEENA MCNAIR, Native American</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0JUDY GRAYBOYES, Soloing, Improv, Rudiments</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02:45- 4:15:\u00a0\u00a0DEBBIE FIER, Mid Eastern &amp;

Then the best part about ROOMINATE is adding the working circuits, by wiring up everything from spinning windmills, to merry-go-rounds, even elevators and more to make it light up!

With four lead vocalists, four horns and a six-piece rhythm section, the ensemble is best described as a \"Remarkable and Rocking Michael Jackson Revue.\" Rather than be limited by a MJ impersonator and pre-recorded backing tracks, the band's unique approach is to celebrate the larger than life performances, imagination and infectious spirit of this legendary artist.\u00a0 The result is a fabulous and thumping 14-piece show band that pays homage to MJ's undeniable talent and timeless dance music.

It was back in May 2011. The photo is posted under that event, so check it out if you have time.</p> <p>There have been several deaths in the house. Most of them\u00a0just because people back in that time period died at home. There was one tragic death at the house, a young girl (I believe a niece of the family) who was not allowed to attend a party given in the garden. She went up to the attic and was leaning out of the window watching the party and fell to her death. Another\u00a0family member drowned, at the age of 82,\u00a0while taking his daily swim in the nearby creek.</p> <p>All of the family members that were buried on the property were relocated due to the creek flooding.

Trail running shoes have much more traction, a close knit upper to keep dirt and water out, and often have a rock plate to protect your foot from the trail. The ease of running trails is increased dramatically by having this type of shoe in your closet. You can get by on most trails with road shoes, but if you think you will be spending a lot of time on the trails it may be worth it to invest in something that will give you some more control over the ground.</p> <p>Time- Run a 9:00/mile on the road? Be ready to add 1-2 minutes per mile more than your road running when you get on the trails. There are hills, obstacles, and terrain to deal with out there. Don't worry about walking up big hills and running down the other side, that's what the best trail runners do! A good rule of thumb is, if you can't see the top of it, maybe you should walk it. Of course we aren't talking about a leisurely walk here, a power hike can do wonders to get you up that hill without too much fatigue on the legs. When you get to the top, don't completely open up and tear down the hill either. Chances are there is going to be another giant hill you are going to have to climb up and you don't want to kill your legs.</p> <p>Maps- It's easy to run to run on the bike path without getting into too much trouble, but trails are a bit trickier. Often there are maps provided at the park you may be going to, but it is also a good idea to print out a map ahead of time. In regards to our Trail Meetup, there is ALWAYS a map linked in the Meetup description. Do yourself the favor to take some time to look at the route and what trails you might get confused at. Print it out and bring it with you, along with the turn by turns. If you have any questions about the directions, email Meghan! The second piece of maps is the ELEVATION map. Check this out! See where the hills are, how big the hills are, and where you think you might struggle. Not all trail runs have the elevation maps attached, mainly because the trails aren't routed on Google maps yet. The ones that are, definitely take a look!</p> <p>Water and Food- Hand in hand with the Time and Maps category, is nutrition. PLEASE bring along at LEAST 8 ounces of water to each trail run. Remember you might be out there for 2 hours for an 8 miler. Make sure you are aware of that and prepare accordingly. Bring your water, bring your food. Always overprepare. It might happen that you take a wrong turn and that 5 mile loop you were running has suddenly turned into 12 miles. This has happened to the best of us, and we don't want you to be unprepared for that situation.</p> <p>Scenery- The places we are going to be running are beautiful, no question about it. However. Keep your eyes on the ground! You may totally see that gigantic root and graciously leap over it with no problem, but the next step there is going to be a tiny little rock you totally over looked, and then you will be meeting the dirt. Be vigilant, keep an eye out where you are going.</p> <p>Weather- It may be 65 and sunny in San Jose, but in the mountains it is significantly colder, especially under tree cover, bring extra layers. If you get to the park and realize it isn't that cold, you can always leave the layers in the car, but it's always better to be safe than sorry. I've seen frost on some local trails when it's been 70 in San Jose. Jackets, gloves, ear warmers, long sleeve shirts.</p> <p>RESPECT- Finally, and most importantly, RESPECT the park you are in. Whatever you bring in, bring out. Don't litter, don't destroy plants, don't go off the marked trail, and don't cut across switch backs. That mountain has been there way before any of us, and let's make sure it will be there after we are gone. With respecting your environment, remember you are in NATURE! This means things like poison oak, animals, etc. If you see deer, don't chase them or yell at them. If you see any baby animal, give it a wide berth. Mama is close by and you don't want to make her angry. Most importantly (and I have to cover this), mountain lions and bobcats. Chances are, you are NOT going to see one of these animals. However, if you do, make yourself appear as large as possible. Raise your arms, open your jacket, be tall. Second, make noise. yell, shout, bang a stick against a tree. DO NOT make a sound that could be confused as the sound of prey. Speak loudly, firmly, and slowly. Third, act like a predator yourself. Maintain eye contact. Never run past or away from a mountain lion. Don't bend down or crouch. Never turn away. Finally, slowly create distance. Back slowly to a spot that gives the mountain lion a path to get away.</p> <p>Finally, you are going to see other people enjoying the park, just like you. Be courteous and respectful. If you want to pass someone, yell ON YOUR LEFT with enough time to allow the person to react and move.</p>", "created": 1387246143000, "venue": {"city": "La Honda", "name": "Portola Redwoods Park, Tarwater Trailhead", "zip": "94020", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.194473, "state": "CA", "address_1": "Portola Redwoods State Park Rd", "country": "us", "lat": 37.259388, "id": 7904702}, "updated": 1389028978000, "visibility": "public", "id": "155871962", "yes_rsvp_count": 6, "time": 1407596400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "how_to_find_us": "TBA", "name": "Second Saturday Trail Series - Portola Redwoods"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 14.853252410888672, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/SFBARC/events/188388152/", "group": {"name": "Bay Area Recumbent Cyclists", "group_lat": 37.7599983215332, "join_mode": "approval", "who": "'Bent Riders", "group_lon": -122.19000244140625, "urlname": "SFBARC", "id": 9399622}, "description": "<p>9:00 AM SHARP ROLLOUT FROM HMB START!</p> <p>Meet on Seymour Street (plenty of street parking) across from the Coastside Baptist Church on the west side of Hwy 1 in Half Moon Bay.

This means we need to migrate Joomla 2.5 sites to Joomla 3 by then (or at least that's the perfect world scenario).</p> <p>In this workshop, we will work with our site at joomlabayarea.com as an example site to migrate from Joomla 2.5 to Joomla 3. We want to go over many more migration examples as well. Attendees can have a development copy of one of their 2.5 sites set up and we can help guide through those migrations too. We won't have time to do super huge sites - so pick a reasonable site with a few third-party extensions and an off-the-shelf template. This is not a prerequisite and you don't have to have a site to migrate for participation in this workshop.</p> <p>Lunch will be provided along with drinks. All of this is included with the cost. We will not have food in the morning, only coffee and water, so grab something before you arrive. Or there is a cafe in the Museum where you can grab a bite.</p> <p><b>Tentative Schedule for this workshop:</b></p> <p><b>9:00-9:30 Registration and Setup</b></p> <p><b>9:30-10:00 Arrive, coffee, get settled</b></p> <p><b>10:30-11:00 Announcements, Joomla Roadmap discussion:</b><br/>This segment will be announcements, discussion about the points of the Joomla Roadmap as it pertains to migrations and the technical specifications for Joomla 3 to lead into the next segment.</p> <p><b>11:00-11:30 Planning and Migration Process Outline:</b><br/>Planning can easily take more than a half hour. In this segment we will go over questions to ask yourself as you plan for migration and what the two processes to migrate from 2.5 to 3 are. This includes technical specifications for Joomla 3, hosting, content and how it relates to responsive design, how to prep the 2.5 site, redesigns, clean-up, goals, and more.</p> <p><b>11:30-12:00 Templates:</b><br/>This segment will address templates and how to handle them for migration from 2.5 to 3. We will only be discussing off-the-shelf third-party templates. We will not be discussing custom templates at this workshop. Learn the things to look for when changing templates and setting the expectation with the client.</p> <p><b>12:00-1:30 Lunch</b><br/>We will have a catered lunch and then explore the incredible Computer History Museum. The museum is a fun, informative and inspiring place to be! You will have time to see the things that interest you most, or just stroll through and see the exhibits at your own pace.</p> <p><b>1:30-2:15 Third-party extensions:</b><br/>Third-party extensions have numerous ways they need to be migrated. Learn the three main processes that most third-party extensions fall into for migration and how to handle them. We will be looking at several extensions to see what to do about them during this segment (for joomlabayarea.com and for the attendee sites).</p> <p>15 minute break</p> <p><b>2:30-4:30 Migrations and troubleshooting:</b><br/>This is the segment that we do the migrations. No matter how many white screens we get, we will go through it and work with it. If time permits, we'll get to some system clean up after the migrations.</p> <p>We will be meeting in the Boole Room at the Computer History Museum.</p> <p>Parking is easy and free in the Computer History Museum Parking lot. We will send attendees more info about parking prior to the event. Do you or someone you know need financial help to attend this workshop? We will have some scholarships available. <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">Email our support staff</a> to request a scholarship and why you want to attend the workshop and a few details about your situation.

command, \"auto-stay\", and recall.\u00a0 We'll also talk about leash/collar equipment, crates and crate training, and manners.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>It's not so much dog training, as it is human training for your dog.\u00a0 It teaches you how to handle and communicate with your dog so that you become the leader in the relationship, instead of allowing your dog to train you ;)</p> <p>We'll meet at the picnic tables between the bathrooms and the rock playground near the basketball court.\u00a0 If you have trouble finding me, you can call me at 40eight- 4three9-4nine38.</p> <p>Required Equipment:</p> <p>- Water for both you and your dog</p> <p>- A collar that fits properly (Flat nylon or leather, training collar [aka: \"choke chain\"], or a pinch collar.\u00a0 If you're using a pinch collar, please make sure you also have another type of collar on your dog to be used as a back up.</p> <p>- 6 foot leash</p> <p>- 15 foot leash (3rd week)</p> <p>- 30 foot (or longer) long line (5th week)</p> <p><br/>- Comfortable footwear (flip flops are not recommended)</p> <p><br/>- Good attitude</p> <p>- Lots and lots of patience</p> <p>Optional Equipment:</p> <p>- Treats for your dog</p> <p>- Folding chair</p> <p>- Sunscreen</p> <p>Rules:</p> <p>- Always keep your dog on leash and under control at all times!</p> <p><br/>- Please do not approach someone else's dog, or more importantly allow your dog to approach someone else's dog with out talking to that dog handler and ensuring it's ok first, and only when the dog's handler/owner is aware you are approaching.\u00a0 No sneak attacks!</p> <p><br/>- Always clean up after yourself and your dog.\u00a0 Even if you think no one saw your dog defecate behind the tree, it is your duty to clean up after your dog.</p> <p><br/>- Fun and joking around is an important aspect of our training, but\u00a0 within reason.\u00a0 Please treat your dog, and the trainer(s), and other class members with respect.</p> <p>- If any inhumane treatment or abuse to your dog is witnessed, you will be asked to leave the class.</p> <p>- Find time to do your home work.</p> <p><br/>Things you must know:</p> <p>- Understand I use people and dogs as an example throughout the class -- Good and bad.\u00a0 Everyone gets to participate in this, so please do not feel picked on.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>- There will be moments of fast paced walking or jogging.\u00a0 If you have injuries or ailments which preclude you from this type of activity, don't do it.\u00a0 Just step aside and allow the others to go b and I will bring the group back to you.\u00a0 This is completely fine.\u00a0 Don't worry about doing anything you don't feel comfortable doing.</p> <p>- If you get tired or frustrated, feel free to take a break.\u00a0 We can talk after class if you have any concerns.</p> <p>- If you do not do the home work every week, you cannot expect to see noticeable results in your dogs behavior, but if you do the home work every week, by the end of the class you should see noticeable results that will make you much happier to have your dog around.</p> <p>- If you think your dog is aggressive, or may be two aggressive for a group class, please contact me to schedule an evaluation of your dog.</p> <p>- Week 1 starts off kind of rough and can be very frustrating for you.\u00a0 Please be patient and remember this is a course that has helped hundreds of people learn to effectively handle the dog.\u00a0 If you're patient with yourself and your dog, and you do the homework, you're going to do great!</p> <p><br/>We will have no class on 8/23,\u00a0 or 9/20.\u00a0 Those classes will be held on 9/27 and 10/4/14.</p>", "created": 1400958395000, "rsvp_limit": 11, "updated": 1402453977000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 5, "event_url":

We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.\u00a0 Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job.

This will be a beginner-friendly trip to the Marin hostel in Rodeo beach. It\u2019s a short, paved trip, and we won\u2019t carry much weight, hence why this is a great introduction to touring.<br/>The main aim of this trip is to visit the Point Bonita lighthouse on their sunset tour, though you can feel free to skip that.</p> <p><b>Bike routes</b><br/>Saturday:<br/>We\u2019ll leave from Embarcadero at 1pm. The road to the hostel is all paved. There is a climb, and it starts out mean, but it gentles off soon enough. We\u2019ll stop at all the batteries to do some exploring (and catch our breath) so bring a lock if you\u2019re concerned. You\u2019re also welcome to go on ahead (or start later and meet us on the way, we should be a pretty obvious bunch). Map here: <a href=\"http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/449176316\">Embarcadero to Marin hostel</a>, 12mi, 1200ft ascent.</p> <p>Sunday:<br/>I\u2019ll probably go back through fire roads + ferry, because that\u2019s fun and we won\u2019t carry much load. This (<a href=\"http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/449177380\">Hostel to ferry on dirt</a>, 12mi, 1140ft ascent) looks a likely route. This alternative route (<a href=\"http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/449177988\">Hostel to ferry paved</a>, 5mi, 500ft ascent) is all paved and the easiest way back.<br/>There are plenty of options for ferries (schedule\u00a0<a href=\"http://goldengateferry.org/schedules/Sausalito.php\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.blueandgoldfleet.com/ferry-services/ferry-schedules/\">here</a>) but you can also ride back to SF fairly trivially.</p> <p>I\u2019ll bring copies of maps for everyone. I expect to be back in SF early afternoon, so I won\u2019t plan for lunch, only a big breakfast + snacks.</p> <p><br/><b>Rodeo beach Marin hostel</b><br/>We have booked two rooms of 5 (one double and 3 twins in each). The first 10 to rsvp who want to stay in those rooms will get a spot. The rest should book themselves in (you can cancel up to a certain date without incurring any fees). The group rooms will most likely be co-ed, so if you don\u2019t want that, you can choose gender-specific dorms when you book individually. Whether you\u2019re in the rooms of 5 or not, it\u2019ll end up being around $30 a night. There is a bicyclist discount we should mention at check-in (which is when we actually pay).<br/>Hostel FAQs <a href=\"http://www.norcalhostels.org/marin/hostel-faqs\">here</a>.</p> <p>PEOPLE IN GROUP ROOMS SO FAR - FULL (cos 2 double beds):<br/>Jean + Magnus - double<br/>Ellie<br/>Lincoln<br/>Kuro Kurosaka<br/>Kevin<br/>Sacha<br/>Sandy<br/>Daphne C</p> <p>\n\nPEOPLE ON WAITING LIST FOR GROUP ROOM (might want to book a dorm bed and cancel it if you get into the group rooms):<br/>Greeshma</p> <p>\n\nPEOPLE WITH THEIR OWN SLEEPING ARRANGEMENT:<br/>Robert Huang<br/>Lee T + 1<br/>Jane<br/>J Scott Matthews<br/>Akiyo<br/>Dan<br/>Scott<br/>Ryan LaBarre</p> <p>\n\nIf you were inclined to camp, there is free camping at Bicentennial (close to the lighthouse) or at Hawk camp (a few miles up a dirt road away from the lighthouse/hostel).

I\u2019ll keep the rsvp updated in order so any cancellation will move down the list.<br/>Those coming on the tour will need to have eaten and be ready to go at 7pm from the hostel. The tour starts at 730pm and finishes at 9pm.

And that we did, bringing you a lineup that has seldom seen its equal in a San Francisco club show. GREEN VELVET is one of the few edm artists whose music has transcended the genre, and whose singing, writing, and musicianship have made him one of the most sought after artists in the world. DJ ICEY is one of the most influential producers of all time, the father of American breakbeat, and one of the finest live Djs on earth. GORGON CITY is one of the hottest production teams on the planet, on the heels of their #4 charting \"Ready for Love\". And then there's the SCUMFROG, a dj's dj with 25 years of experience making the underground into hallowed ground. They will be joined by local heroes, Lights Down Low Dj's Richie Panic and Corey Sleazemore plus Silent Frisco with Motion Potion Matt Haze and Dj Dials outside. This WILL SELL OUT.

There IS such a tool, and it's called the shamanic journey.</p> <p><br/>The shamanic journeying method I teach comes from Core Shamanism, a technique synthesized by anthropologist Michael Harner based on his study of many diverse cultures throughout the world. As such, we all have equal birthright to it, no matter who we are or where we're from... and, it works for all of us.</p> <p><br/>Deceptively simple yet amazingly profound, the shamanic journey can transform your life. I know that's a bold claim! Yet I make it because it has transformed my own life, and the lives of hundreds of students and clients to whom I've taught it over the years.</p> <p><br/>At this class, suitable for beginners OR more advanced practitioners, we'll:</p> <p>\u2022 Go over the basics of safe shamanic journeying. (There are some very important things NOT to do, as well as some practices and understandings that will help you journey more easily and effectively.)</p> <p>\u2022 We'll do an initial journey to help everyone present make contact with an inner guide (or deepen your contact, if you're already working with a guide.)</p> <p>\u2022 We'll explore the most powerful healing practices available in shamanism, how to prepare for them, and how to enlist your guides' assistance in implementing them.</p> <p><br/>\u2022 We'll do a second journey in which you can start on one of these advanced healing practices... or continue deepening your connection with your guide or with non-ordinary reality. (Everyone can journey! But everyone moves through the process at a different pace, and I aim to teach in a manner that allows each person support to go where they need to go, at their own speed and in their own way.)</p> <p>\u2022 We'll close with some discussion and practice of how you can keep these powerful tools and understandings alive and growing in your life - even in a culture that doesn't understand or support them :)</p> <p>If you haven't come to a Meetup with me before, check out the reviews for previous gatherings. These classes are always amazing - and I say that without boasting. I'm a good teacher, but what really makes the classes life-changing are the wise, loving, compassionate beings who work with me and through me - and who are available to work with and through you, too!</p> <p>For more info about me, please feel free to check out my website, &lt;a&gt;www.EvolutionarySupport.com.&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>&lt;a&gt;Oh, and a note about fees. The fee I charge is the lowest I'm aware of in the Bay Area for a day of powerful, guided shamanic practice.

This class is designed as an overview to help you better understand your camera, the digital workflow and how to make better images. We cover basic features of the DSLR camera to include choosing lenses and filters, ISO, white balance, shutter, aperture and program modes, EV, exposure, bracketing, focusing, resolution, histograms and more. The main objective is to help you understand the fundamentals of exposure so that you can get your camera out of auto mode and start making images the way you want them to look. Once you have the skills to get the correct exposure under any conditions, we can shift our efforts to proper techniques for focus, light metering, depth of field and some basic rules of composition.</p> <p><b>Please Note:</b> Entrance is via the <a href=\"http://goo.gl/maps/AXrv\">Academy's Staff and Research Entrance</a> at the back door located at 75 Nancy Pelosi Drive.

It reveals how food, not medication, consistently proves to be a dominant factor in healing and reversing illness and disease. Illustrating these points are interviews with leading medical and nutrition experts such as Neal Barnard, MD, founder of Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine; Michael Gregor, MD, founder of NutritionFacts.org; Gabriel Cousens, MD; Dr. Brian Clement; Brenda Davis RD, and Lewis Mehl-Madrona, MD.</p> <p>View the trailer of this film at <a href=\"http://sanaview.com/bethanys-story.aspx?affiliateswap=SMC\" class=\"linkified\">http://sanaview.com/bethanys-story.aspx?affiliateswap=SMC</a>.</p> <p>At age thirteen, Bethany was left paralyzed from a series of bad reactions to medication. For years doctors told her she would never walk again. On her own, Bethany discovered and adopted a vegan (raw) plant-based diet and within a short amount of time she was out of her chair standing and walking. \u201cOur body has this amazing ability to rejuvenate and repair and regenerate,\u201d says Dr. Michael Gregor.</p> <p>The film chronicles Bethany\u2019s illness from onset to recovery and includes heart-wrenching accounts from her friends and family. Understanding and witnessing some of the incredible challenges this family encountered truly shows the impact serious health issues have on everyone. Hearing the scientific facts presented by all of the medical experts brings this solution fully to the forefront. As Dr. Gabriel Cousens states in the film, \u201cThese are not miracles. We have the science that makes it very clear,\u201d shows that this is not just an anecdotal account of one odd story, but a scientifically proven solution. Dr. Brian Clement states that raw foods is not a fad but a proven solution that is here to stay.</p> <p>The film's director and founder of the SanaView non-profit organization, Janet McKee, hopes the audience becomes inspired to begin making better choices with food and lifestyle:</p> <p>\"I\u2019ve known for some time that food choices are critical for good physical health, but after working on this film, I have no doubt in my mind that there is no greater medicine than food for true healing of the body...Inspiration is the first step to helping others make positive changes, and this film is a key tool to create the desire in others,\" says McKee.</p> <p>\"We have had so many people tell us how the film has changed their lives, and some, too, who have had amazing recoveries from illness when they changed their diet.

Spearheaded by social worker Dan Cohen and captured on camera over the course of three years by filmmaker Michael Rossato-Bennett, we learn that songs from a patient's past can awaken memories and emotions that have been asleep for years, sometimes decades. Within a moment of hearing \"I Get Around\" by the Beach Boys, Alzheimer's patient Marylou jolts back to life, dancing around the living room and expressing a euphoria her husband hasn't witnessed since her illness took effect. Countless instances in Alive Inside provide proof that music stimulates activity in dementia-affected parts of the brain and transforms the quality of life of those often left to languish in silence. Through revealing conversations with renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks and musician Bobby McFerrin, as well as powerful firsthand experiments conducted by Cohen in nursing homes, this groundbreaking documentary demonstrates how connecting the elderly to the music they love not only combats memory loss but also supplements a broken health-care system often indifferent to interpersonal connections.<br/>(Review from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2593392/\">IMDB</a>)</p> <p><b>Dinner Discussion:</b> Afterwards, we'll meet to discuss the film and the Enneagram over dinner at a nearby restaurant.

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. In <i>The Sixth Extinction</i>, two-time winner of the National Magazine Award and <i>New Yorker</i> writer Elizabeth Kolbert draws on the work of scores of researchers in half a dozen disciplines, accompanying many of them into the field: geologists who study deep ocean cores, botanists who follow the tree line as it climbs up the Andes, marine biologists who dive off the Great Barrier Reef. She introduces us to a dozen species, some already gone, others facing extinction, including the Panamian golden frog, staghorn coral, the great auk, and the Sumatran rhino. Through these stories, Kolbert provides a moving account of the disappearances occurring all around us and traces the evolution of extinction as concept, from its first articulation by Georges Cuvier in revolutionary Paris up through the present day. The sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy; as Kolbert observes, it compels us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.</p>", "created": 1403932354000, "rsvp_limit": 22, "updated": 1403932354000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 22, "time": 1407715200000, "duration": 5400000, "waitlist_count": 5, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "191768142", "name": "The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History by Elizabeth Kolbert"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 28.047212600708008, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-3D-Printing-3D-Modeling-3D-Scanning-mixers/events/194193462/", "group": {"name": "Bay Area's 3D Printing, 3D Modeling, 3D Scanning FREE mixers", "group_lat": 37.84000015258789, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Printsters", "group_lon": -122.22000122070312, "urlname": "Bay-Area-3D-Printing-3D-Modeling-3D-Scanning-mixers", "id": 11204602}, "description": "<p>There has been a lot of developments in the past 4 months in the industry and Nick and Liza of <b>HoneyPoint3D</b> will give an hour lecture to bring you up to date!

As a Warrior she has loved choosing her own mission and fate, sometimes to the detriment of her success! When someone says \u201cGo left\u201d\u2026she wants to go right! It wasn\u2019t until she was introduced to Napoleon Hill that her business world changed. Then she realized that her gift to the world is bringing women in business together in the spirit of MasterMind to organize their knowledge and actually earn what they deserve. Crazy part, is she has always been a speaker\u2026.she actually started in toastmasters in the 7th grade! She competed in oratory in high school and had the honor of speaking on the same stage as the Reverend Jesse Jackson in 1985. WAAAAYYYYYY back in the 90\u2019s she was a speaker for CareerTrack, Fred Pryor Seminars, and National Seminars Group. With over 600 speakers, she was in the top 1% of Back of Room sales and the only woman! As a business owner, no matter WHAT YOU SELL, speaking is one of the smartest strategies to getting clients now, but without a presentation that converts you are just inspiring, or very helpful. Ann now shows entrepreneurs how to get out of their own way, organize what they do, present it to audiences and sell more with ease. ANY business can use this skill as a gateway to closing more business.</p> <p>$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $</p> <p><br/>Successful Thinkers Network is a group of like minded and committed individuals who believe people will buy or use product / service from people they like, know, and trust.\u00a0 Building relationship is key to the membership in helping others move forward.\u00a0 Members share ideas and information to benefit the community and their business.</p> <p>The Successful Thinkers Network's mission is to help develop relationships that will enable members to find solutions to business challenges.\u00a0 Attend our meetings to learn more about how our concept works for you and your business.</p> <p><b>VERY IMPORTANT: There is no cost for the event.\u00a0 We just ask you to support the local economy by ordering lunch from our host restaurant.</b></p> <p>The group meets every Monday from 11:30am to 1:30pm.\u00a0 Everyone is welcome!</p>", "created": 1385511219000, "venue": {"city": "Fremont", "name": "City Beach", "zip": "94538", "repinned": false, "lon": -121.951096, "state": "CA", "address_1": "4020 Technology Pl", "country": "us", "lat": 37.510571, "id": 4387732}, "updated": 1405195719000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 6, "time": 1407781800000, "duration": 7200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "drsqfhyslbpb", "name": "Fremont Successful Thinkers Network"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 28.939102172851562, "utc_offset": -25200000, "fee": {"description": "per person", "required": "0", "accepts": "paypal", "label": "Price", "currency": "USD", "amount": 5}, "group": {"name": "Internet Marketing of the Bay Area", "group_lat": 37.68000030517578, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Internet Marketing Pros", "group_lon": -121.75, "urlname": "internetmarketingbayarea", "id": 499634}, "description": "<p>We'll be having our regular meetup meeting this month with the following agenda:</p> <p><b>5:30-6:00 p.m.</b> Networking, getting something to eat/drink, and getting settled</p> <p><b>6:00-6:15 p.m.</b> Round robin - Your name, a little about you, what you want to learn or give</p> <p><b>6:15-7:00 p.m. Presentation: TBD</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://img2.meetupstatic.com/981263258369601089/img/smileys/smile.gif\" /></p> <p><b>7:00-7:30 p.m.</b> Ask anything &amp; live Web site reviews (about SEO, social media, local business marketing, and internet marketing)</p> <p>Its $5 to attend, if you pay in advance online.

We take over the side section in this large open-doored restaurant, next to the bar, enjoy some tapitas and get to know each other in Spanish. This Mega section attracts many members, so if you want to get a spot RSVP right away. Likewise, update your RSVP if your plans change to open up a spot, since we almost always have a waiting list.</p> <p>So how does it work? Simple, show up, introduce yourself and chat in Spanish (ONLY). Most people are coming on their own as well, so you will be the \"norm\" if you are too. Everyone is very welcoming and friendly. All levels are welcome, with the only rule being it is a Spanish only event (occasionally, by the way, we do post \"Spanish optional\" events). This group has many native speakers who are regulars, many advanced speakers who lived in Spanish-speaking countries for years, and a fair amount of learners. We tend to stay on our feet to promote mingling and meeting and socializing with more people.</p> <p>These events are FREE, but anyone joining will need to purchase one drink or food item. This is to keep our venues happy (and sorry, water doesn't count as \"one\" drink ; \u00a0) This is important since without your participation in keeping venues happy they might make us \"guarantee the bar\" or pay for the space. As long as you order a little bit of this or that, it will be good enough.

Among other advantages, this means that no mixing server learns which output addresses and input addresses in a mixing transaction belong together. Since CoinShuffle is based on the idea of CoinJoin, theft of coins is excluded as well. CoinShuffle does not require complex cryptography and performs well in practice, even in scenarios with a large number (about 50) of participants.

Sharing this vision, one hopes that the viewer takes in the resulting photograph in such a way that they may sense beyond thought, the intention of the photographer, as well as discover their own inner wisdom.</p> <p><b><i>\u201cOne should not only photograph things for what they are but for what else they are.\u201d \u2013 Minor White\u00a0</i></b></p> <p>Lisa Winston is a graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology an award-winning photographer and creative and spiritual mentor.

All of them can record what you are seeing. But, you have to SEE\u201d. - Ernst Haas</i></b></p> <p>\"My first step when I started a new architectural project was to review the publications I respected. \u00a0For a job in Florida, Southern California or another southern state it was D\u00e9cor de Provence, C\u00f4t\u00e9 Sud and LUX. \u00a0 The goal was twofold. \u00a0First, to become aware of new photographic styles and bring something new and valuable to my clients. Second, and most importantly, I was priming my mind\u2019s eye for the critical first step in creating great photographs, the ability to see and form a mental image that would meet my clients goals.\u00a0</p> <p><b><i>\u201cYou don't take a photograph, you make it.\u201d Ansel Adams</i></b></p> <p>The next and equally important step is working with the craft of photography to make what is imagined visible. \u00a0He will discuss how to use the camera\u2019s manual settings and the Zone System to create consistent high-quality images that are also faster and easier to produce.</p> <p>Glen Graves attended the Brooks Institute in the mid 1970s and established a successful career as a freelance commercial / architectural / personal photographer. \u00a0He has traveled nationwide working for companies such as General Motors, Ford, FTD, Formica, Delta Faucets, the Lear Corporation, the New York Port Authority and innumerable Architectural firms and related companies. \u00a0He has been published in Architectural Digest, \u00a0the Robb Report and every major shelter publication. \u00a0<br/>He is now the happy warrior teaching photography classes and shooting for a few select clients.

Millions have lost jobs, homes, and healthcare. Many with jobs watch pensions, benefits, and job security decline. While most live with increasing uncertainty, the system makes the very wealthy even richer. In eye-opening interviews with prominent economist Richard Wolff, David Barsamian probes the root causes of the current crisis, its unjust social costs, and what can and should be done to turn things around. While others blame corrupt bankers and unregulated speculators or the government or even the poor who borrowed, the authors show that the causes of the crisis run much deeper. They reach back to the 1970s when the capitalist system itself shifted, ending the century-old pattern of rising wages for Americans and thereby enabling the top 1% to become ultra-rich at the expense of the 99%. Since then, economic injustice has become chronic and further corrupted politics. Occupy's indignation with the whole system mobilizes a diverse range of Americans who seek basic change.\u00a0<i>Occupying the Economy</i>\u00a0not only clarifies and analyzes the crisis in US capitalism today, it also points toward solutions that can shape a far better future for all.</p> <p><b>Richard Wolff</b>\u00a0is professor of economics at U.

(p.s., it's totally PG-13) It's an evening where, through only talking, we begin to experience these exhilarating, normal, often ignored feelings -- referred to as TurnON.

His connection to New Orleans roots were deepened by his father, a Big Chief in the African and Native American influenced culture of New Orleans\u2019 Black Mardi Gras Indians. The culture is an offshoot culture of Congo Square, one of the only known places in North America where Africans openly participated in their culture in the 1700\u2019s and 1800\u2019s.</p> <p>Harrison recorded, \u201cQuantum Leap\u201d in 2012 which musicians and critics agree is a next step for jazz. With quantum jazz Harrison has opened up new areas for time, harmony, and melody.

And with 70% of the rivers\u2019 water supporting agriculture, the river already runs dry before it reaches its natural end at the Gulf of California. Unless action is taken, the river will continue its retreat \u2013 a potentially catastrophic scenario for the millions who depend on it.</p> <p>In\u00a0WATERSHED, we meet Jeff Ehlert, a fly fishing guide in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado rancher Dan James, Delta restoration worker Edith Santiago, Navajo Council member Glojean Todacheene, Rifle Colorado Mayor Keith Lambert, Los Angeles native Jimmy Lizama and a group of Outward Bound teens rafting down the Colorado River as they all reflect a compelling new water ethic\u2014one that illuminates how letting go of the ways of old can lead to a path of coexisting with enough for all.</p> <p>The Redford Center created\u00a0WATERSHED\u00a0as a inspirational social action tool for people who want to engage. Promoting personal water conservation pledges of 5% \u2013 symbolic of the small amount of the rivers\u2019 flow required to reconnect the river to its delta \u2013 and garnering donations to help purchase the water rights necessary to restore the connectivity,\u00a0WATERSHED\u00a0is a central tool in a larger grassroots effort focused on saving the Colorado River and supporting the communities throughout the river basin.</p> <p>Presented by the Redford Center</p> <p>A Production of the Redford Center and Kontent Films</p> <p>Writer / Director: Mark Decena</p> <p>Executive Producers: Robert Redford, Teri Heyman, Lee Bycel</p> <p>Producers: James Redford, Jill Tidman</p> <p>Producer / Post Production Supervisor: Renata Foucr\u00e9</p> <p>Co-producer: Scott Compton</p> <p>Director of Photography: John Behrens</p> <p>Editor: Matt Notaro</p> <p>Story Editors: John Dilley, Forrest Pound</p> <p>Assistant Editors: Joanna Hidalgo, Luke Shock</p> <p>Editorial House: Remedy Editorial</p> <p>Additional Photography: Fearghal ODea, Forrest Pound, Renata Foucr\u00e9, Mark Decena</p> <p>Associate Producers: Forrest Pound, Tye Davis</p> <p>Content Advisor: Barry Nelson, NRDC</p> <p>Distribution Partners: NRDC, McSweeney\u2019s, Save The Colorado and Sonoran Institute</p> <p>Associate Story Developers: Jordan Bass, Ira Chute, Chris Ying, Emily Doe</p> <p>Publicity, Marketing and Distribution Consultant: Diana Iles Parker</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://riverredfilm.com/stage_ws/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/River2.png\" /></p> <p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/3mcHrzOImoY\" class=\"embedded\">http://youtu.be/3mcHrzOImoY</a></p> <p>Meeting time: \u00a06:15pm</p> <p>Showtime: 6:30pm</p> <p>Location: \u00a0Community Hall at the Lafayette Library</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/7/0/600_379959792.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Should you have a problem finding us before or after the meetup, send us a mobile text with your location to\u00a0[masked] (number to be used only during event hours)</p> <p>If you need or can provide a carpool, please indicate it in your RSVP and feel free to arrange it using the comment box below.</p> <p>Questions?

Doing this will confirm that the benchmark tests what it says it tests, and will help in understanding the results. In active benchmarking, performance is analyzed while the benchmark is running. This will use tools available on SmartOS (DTrace, iostat, mpstat, etc.).

He's currently a member of the TC39, the Javascript standards body designing the next version of JS. He specializes in building web servers and clients using functional reactive programming, and was the first user of the Reactive Extensions Framework. He's also responsible for \"Falkor\", a RESTful data access framework that powers most Netflix clients. A highly-rated speaker, he has spoken about reactive programming at YOW!, QCon, CodeMesh, and given Channel 9 interviews on the subject. He has also authored interactive training software to help developers learn about functional reactive programming.</p> <p><b>What does a mouse drag event have in common with an Array of numbers?</b><br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The answer to this question may surprise you: they are both collections. This key insight holds the key to dramatically simplifying asynchronous programming in Javascript. In this talk you will learn how you can use the familiar Javascript Array methods to create surprisingly expressive asynchronous programs. Using just a few functions, you will learn how to do the following:<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 * Declaratively build complex events out of simple events (ex. drag n' drop)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 * Coordinate and sequence multiple Ajax requests<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 * Reactively update UI's in response to data changes<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 * Eliminate memory leaks caused by neglecting to unsubscribe from events<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 * Gracefully propagate and handle asynchronous exceptions</p> <p><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nIn this talk we'll be exploring the Reactive Extensions (Rx) library (<a href=\"https://rx.codeplex.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rx.codeplex.com/</a>) which allows us to treat events as collections. You'll learn about how Netflix uses Rx on the client and the server, allowing us to build end-to-end reactive systems. We'll also contrast Rx with Promises, another popular approach to building asynchronous programs in Javascript.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p><br/>Please come and join us for a fun, informational evening where you can hear Jafar speak as well as meet other interesting people.</p> <p>Snacks and beverages will be served.

These transmissions are passed as a Free \"Give Away\" from spirit...</p> <p>Please view the videos below to gain a deeper understanding of the Munay-Ki Rites and what to expect in our community circle!</p> <p><br/>Many have felt a calling from spirit and are awakening to make a difference in this world. We, as a people, are on a vision quest. Living a vision and questing for more of who we truly can become. We invite you to discover the Nine Rites of Munay-Ki and engage the quest for deeper, broader vision of who and what you truly are.</p> <p>The Nine Rites of the Munay-Ki are transmissions and attunements kept alive and handed down by lineage keepers of the wisdom traditions of shamanic cultures worldwide. The external form varies from culture to culture but the essence of the transmission is universal. What is handed down are transmissions of energetic seeds that when nurtured, quicken the path to spiritual development and enlightenment. They quicken our journey towards who and what we are becoming as a species. The seeds of these rites can grow within anyone. This is our human birthright and path.</p> <p>The Munay-Ki rites, as brought to us through the Q'ero Shamans of the Peruvian Andes, are a path of fire and a path of lightning; a fast track to recognizing our true divine nature. This all is a journey in space, time and energy. The\u00a0 Munay-Ki is the\u00a0 rocket fuel for this journey.</p> <p><br/>We are honored to share these rites with you...</p> <p>Join us now on this journey of discovery.</p> <p>The adventure continues the 3rd Friday of every month.</p> <p>\n\n\nFor more information please contact:</p> <p>Kent Dorsey - <a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a></p> <p>Suzanne Savage - &lt;a&gt;[masked]&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>Please visit: <a href=\"http://www.centerforshamanichealing.com/\">The Center For Shamanic Healing</a>,</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.munaykiawakening.com/\">Munay-Ki Awakening</a></p> <p>and</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.spiritssong.com/\">Spirits Song</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/eventReg?llr=sobzuldab&amp;oeidk=a07e3v2pul8ff6a714a\"><br/></a></p> <p>FREE EVENT</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Nine Great Rites of the Munay KI<br/>Dr. Alberto Villoldo introduces the rites of the Munay KI. Rites that have the potential to change the world. Munay Sonqo... Thank you for this gift to the world.</p> <p>undefined</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>This video shows each of the Nine Rites being passed:</p> <p><br/>undefined</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>NINE GREAT RITES OF THE MUNAY-KI</p> <p><br/>The Nine Rites of the Munay-Ki consists of two type of rites. The Foundation Rites and the Lineage Rites. The Foundation Rites consist of\u00a0 The Healer\u2019s Rite, The Bands of Power, The Harmony Rites and The Seers\u2019 Rite prepare us with the needed tools for the initiations to come. These Foundation Rites prepares our luminous energy field to hold the vibration and power available in the next five rites, the Lineage Rites</p> <p>MUNAY = LOVE FROM THE HEART</p> <p>KI = ENGAGED AND IN MOTION</p> <p><br/>Foundation Rites</p> <p>Healer's Rite</p> <p>Connects you to a lineage of luminous beings from the past, who come to assist you in your personal transformation.\u00a0 Awakens the healing power in your hands so that everyone you touch is blessed. There is tremendous spiritual assistance available, and these luminous ones work in our sleep to heal the wounds of the past and of our ancestors.</p> <p>Bands of Power</p> <p>Five luminous energetic bands representing earth, air, fire, water, and pure light that are woven into the luminous energy field (LEF) for protection. Through Intent they act as filters, breaking down all negative energy that comes toward the person, into one of the five elements.\u00a0 These energies then feed your LEF instead of making you sick. The Bands of Power are always 'on', and negative energies bounce right off them. In a world filled with fear, the bands provide essential protection. The Bands bring us into union with all of the elements. They do not insulate us from life, but rather deepen our connection and attunment with the Earth and all the elements.</p> <p>Harmony Rite</p> <p>You receive seven allies bringing gifts of transformation and harmony. Four allies,\u00a0 organizing principles of creation, are placed into your four lower Chakras as well as three \"Archangels\" into your upper Chakras.\u00a0 In the first Chakra, you receive the ally of serpent; jaguar goes into the second; hummingbird into the third; and eagle into the fourth; next you receive three archangels:\u00a0 the Keeper of the Lower World (our unconscious), the Keeper of the Middle World (our waking world), and the Protector of the Upper World (our super conscious). These allies are transmitted into your Chakras as seeds of energy, each a particular vibration. This is a path of literal enlightenment - Infusing light into each Chakra.</p> <p>Seer's Rite</p> <p>Reawakens the Shaman's way to perceiving the World. Five luminous Extra-cerebral pathways of light are woven and installed that connect the visual cortex with the third eye and two are woven that connect the heart chakra to the visual cortex. This awakens the \"inner seer\" and your ability to perceive the invisible world of energy and Spirit.</p> <p>Vibration of Angels and Archangels</p> <p>Lineage Rites:</p> <p>Daykeeper Rite</p> <p>This is a lineage Rite of the Divine Feminine. You connect to a lineage of master healers from the past who have fully awakened their nurturing ways. Daykeepers are able to call on the ancient altars to heal and bring balance to the earth, call on the sun to rise each day, and bring humans into harmony with mother Earth following the cycle of life.\u00a0 They are the midwives, herbalists and curanderas.\u00a0 This rite helps you begin to heal your inner feminine, step beyond fear, and practice peace.</p> <p>Wisdomkeeper's Rite</p> <p>This lineage rite offers gifts of the Divine Masculine. You connect to a lineage of luminous beings from the past and the future who have defeated death and stepped outside of time. This rite awakens stories that lift people up, speaking from a mythic realm to engage and lift with teaching stories. This rite is associated with the snow-capped mountains, perhaps a distant memory of our ancestors from the Himalayas. This rite helps you to begin to heal your inner masculine, step outside of time, become steeped in the medicine teachings and taste infinity.</p> <p>Earthkeeper Rite</p> <p>This rite connects you to the archangels that are guardians of our galaxy. The Earthkeepers, who are stewards of all life on the Earth, come under the direct protection of these archangels and can summon their power when they need to in order to bring healing and balance to any situation.This rite connects you to the stars, and to the sun, our local star. It helps you learn the ways of the seer and dream the world into being.</p> <p>Starkeeper's Rite</p> <p>This rite anchors you safely to the time after the great change, said to occur around 2012.\u00a0 Your physical body begins to evolve into homo luminous, the aging process is slowed down, your DNA is re-informed, and you become more resistant to disease. When you receive these rites, you acquire stewardship of the time to come and all future generations.</p> <p><br/>Creator Rite</p> <p>Awakens the Creator-light within and brings forth a sense of stewardship for all creation, from the smallest grain of sand to the largest cluster of galaxies in the universe.\u00a0 Once attained only through direct transmission from Spirit, it is now possible to transmit from one person to another.</p> <p>As you work with the germination of these rites you'll be touched and blessed by angels. You simply need to open yourself to the wisdom of the Earthkeepers, and all will be bestowed upon you.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Facilitated by Kent Dorsey &amp; Suzanne Savage</p> <p>Please visit <a href=\"http://www.munaykiawakening.com/Welcome.html\">Munay Ki Awakening</a> .</p> <p>Please visit the <a href=\"http://www.munaykiawakening.com/Welcome.html\">Center For Shamanic Healing</a> website.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>FREE EVENT</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>I understand that this and all other Center For Shamanic Healing training programs and events are offered for teaching purposes only and not for the purposes of providing healing or treating any student or participant for any physical or mental condition or illness.</p> <p>Disclaimer</p> <p>Shamanic\u00a0 services and information on this website are offered to compliment medical and psychological advice and treatments.

Valuation makes or breaks a company. It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.\u00a0 Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job.

Robert's real address will be emailed to those who RSVP.</p> <p>History of the Luau</p> <p><br/>A\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.hawaii-luaus.com/history.htm\">luau</a>,\u00a0a feast to mark an important celebratory occasion, such as a coming of age or visitors, is culturally rooted, festive and all about food, fun and family. Luaus have been part of Hawaiian culture since long before Westerners arrived to the islands. Up until about 150 years ago, Polynesians called their big celebratory feasts \u2018aha \u2018aina. These events were usually somewhat formal, with more ceremony and not such a party atmosphere.\u00a0</p> <p>The modern term Luau may have originated from the great coed feasts of the Hawaiian King Kamehameha II. In traditional Hawaii, men and women were not allowed to eat together and all women were forbidden to eat certain kinds of foods in Hawaii. King Kamehameha II abolished these laws and many other religious laws in the year 1819 and validated this change by having a symbolic feast with women invited.\u00a0</p> <p>At this feast one of the main dishes involved the wrapping of chicken in the young leaves of the Taro plant and baking it in coconut milk. This dish was called 'Luau' and as a result of its being one of the main courses of these feasts the feasts themselves came to be called 'Luaus.' Traditional Luaus are eaten on the ground, with food placed on Ti Leaves that cover a type of woven mat called the 'Lauhala' mats.\u00a0</p> <p>the lei</p> <p>Guests at Luaus receive Leis as they arrive. The\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.hawaiiflowerlei.com/leitradition.aspx\">Lei</a>\u00a0\u00a0is a necklace or headdress of woven flowers or shells and is given as a display of affection. A lei should be a welcomed celebration of one person's affection to another. Therefore, always accept a lei, never refuse.\u00a0</p> <p>The proper way to wear a lei is gently draped over the shoulders, hanging down both in front and in back. It is considered rude to remove a lei from your neck in the presence of the person who gave it to you, so if you must, be discreet.\u00a0</p> <p>Also when dressing up for the Luau women can place a flower behind their right or left ear. Placing a flower over the left ear indicates that one is taken or in a relationship and placing a flower over the right ear indicates that one is available.</p> <p>pu: the hawaiian conch shell</p> <p>Pu, a Hawaiian\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.aloha-hawaii.com/hawaii/conch+shells/\">conch shell</a>\u00a0, is a large seashell that is blow into like a trumpet and often played for ceremonies. Made of two kinds of large shells, Triton or Cassis cornuta, it is capable of emitting a loud sound carrying as far as two miles. The volume depends on the style of blowing rather than breath volume capacity.</p> <p>In ancient times, the Pu was sometimes used to accompany chants, and most often used to announce the beginning of a ceremony and also to communicate the arrival of incoming ships.</p> <p>Today the Pu is used to announce the opening of the Hawaii State Legislature, presentation of the royal court at hula festivals and for traditional ceremonies. The Pu is also a popular commencement tool at weddings and luaus, and also has been used to honor royalty and famous people.</p> <p>fire dancing</p> <p>Fire dancing, now very popular on the Hawaiian Islands, is a tradition that came from traditional Somoan knife dancing. The ailao, a fierce traditional dance that involves the twirling of the nifo oti (war knife), was a pre-war ritual in Samoa used to psyche up warriors. Letuli Olo Misilagi was the first man to add fire to the traditional Samoan ailao, or knife dance.</p> <p>The\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.aloha-hawaii.com/dining/samoan+fire+knife+dance/\">Samoan fire knife dance</a></p> <p>\u00a0is more than a popular spectacle that adds sizzle to a Hawaiian luau. It\u2019s a tradition that has been passed from generation to generation, with each adding a new layer of style, boldness and skill.</p> <p>Today, of course, the Samoan fire knife dance is a show-stopping staple in Polynesian revues or luaus. There are fire knife dance competitions held throughout the Pacific, including the annual World Fire Knife Dance Competition at the Polynesian Cultural Center (PCC) on Oahu.</p> <p>Says event founder Pulefano Galeai, \"This unique event combines great athletic skill, unflinching bravery and ever-present danger to bring out the best in these competitors. It\u2019s exciting to see the culture of Samoa take center stage with participation from people around the world.\"\u00a0</p> <p>grass skirts</p> <p>The most famous symbol of the Hawaiian hula is the\u00a0<a href=\"http://library.thinkquest.org/J0110077/hulahistory.htm\">grass skirt</a>\u00a0. The grass skirt was introduced to Hawaii in the early 1800s by laborers who arrived in Hawaii from the Gilbert Islands. Traditionally the Hawaiians used Ti leaves; the Ti leaf is wider than the thinner strands of grass that are used today.</p>", "created": 1400689439000, "venue": {"city": "Discovery Bay", "name": "Robert's House", "repinned": false, "lon": -121.678108, "state": "CA", "address_1": "111 SELLERS AVENUE", "country": "us", "lat": 37.898193, "id": 20251612}, "updated": 1402498141000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 21, "time": 1408226400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "184353002", "name": "LEI'D BACK HAWAIIAN LUAU PARTY"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 28.707279205322266, "utc_offset": -25200000, "fee": {"description": "per person", "required": "1", "accepts": "paypal", "label": "Price", "currency": "USD", "amount": 49}, "group": {"name": "Women in Tech", "group_lat": 37.790000915527344, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Members", "group_lon": -122.41999816894531, "urlname": "womentech", "id": 3273522}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://www.startupsaturdays.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Intro-to-Mobile-Development.jpg\" /></p> <p>\n\n&lt;strong style=\"font-size : medium\"&gt;About the class</b><br/>Learn to make mobile applications!

The band members pride themselves on serving up a helping of non-stop 70's disco dance hits and 80's and 90' s pop classics with an uncanny knack of performing songs that you will be surprised to discover you knew all the words to, such as \"YMCA,\" \"Stayin\u2019 Alive,\" \"Dancing Queen,\" \"Le Freak,\" \"Disco Inferno,\" and many more (see song list). The result is always an audience dancing along and singing along.</p> <p>Over the last decade The Cheeseballs have performed everywhere from Las Vegas to Hawaii, at large public events, private parties and capacity-filled dance clubs. They have rung in the New Year at venues ranging from the Atrium of San Francisco's landmark Hyatt Embarcadero Hotel to historic Union Station in Kansas City, MO. The Cheeseballs memorably sung their own groovy acappela rendition of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" to 50,000 San Francisco Giants fans at SBC Park. Whether playing to a crowd of 100 or 10,000, they'll make sure everyone ends up on the dance floor. The Cheeseballs headline and sell out at all of the Bay Area's premier venues, including Bimbo's 365 Club, The Great American Music Hall, and Slim's.</p> <p>The band is comprised of 8 performers dressed in dazzling retro disco outfits and presents a parade of personalities who alternate lead vocals with plenty of exuberantly choreographed dance moves.

If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years, and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe opposes him. The quest for the king\u2019s freedom destroys his adviser, the brilliant Cardinal Wolsey, and leaves a power vacuum.<br/>Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell is a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people and a demon of energy: he is also a consummate politician, hardened by his personal losses, implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph?<br/>In inimitable style, Hilary Mantel presents a picture of a half-made society on the cusp of change, where individuals fight or embrace their fate with passion and courage. With a vast array of characters, overflowing with incident, the novel re-creates an era when the personal and political are separated by a hairbreadth, where success brings unlimited power but a single failure means death.<br/>Amazon: Overall 3.5 stars out 5, based on 1,369 reviews<br/>Print Length: 604 pages<br/>Publisher: Henry Holt and Co.

We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.\u00a0 Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job.

But they didn't start that way.</p> <p>All big businesses started small by definition.

Numerous studies suggest a coming world of tens of billions of devices (a half-dozen for every human on earth) by 2020 (bit.ly/M2qBII). One reason this is happening is because it has never been easier for garage tinkerers and hobbyists to prototype a consumer or commercial device for later manufacture and sale. Getting started with both the hardware and software is incredibly inexpensive. For less than $100, you can order an Arduino or a Raspberry PI.</p> <p><br/><b>Understanding the Cloud</b></p> <p>These devices rarely have value unless they\u2019re connected to something else, perhaps a cloud back end that receives data and sends commands. But connecting to, communicating with and managing these devices from an application running in the cloud presents some special challenges. The sheer number of devices, as well as their limited battery life and bandwidth, forces companies developer to carefully consider all options.</p> <p>In this session we will review the landscape and take a close look on the role of cloud computing with respect to the world of M2M and IoT. We will address key issues, such as bandwidth and security. We will debunk the myth that IPv6 and virtual private networks (VPNs) are simple, efficient, and secure, and will propose some specific recommendations for using the Cloud to solve these challenges. We will look at some specific examples using the Arduino and the Raspberry PI.</p> <p><b>The building of a working product - Soup to Nuts</b></p> <p>We will also present \u201cSmartDoor,\u201d where we really roll up our sleeves, both from a hardware and software point of view and learn what it takes to truly embrace this new computing paradigm. SmartDoor and is the reference IoT product we will build from the ground up, making it possible for any one to start embracing the Internet of Things.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Soldering a doorbell to the device</b></p> <p>If you look closely, you will see a doorbell and a camera on top of a PI device. The idea is that someone arrives on your doorstep and rings your doorbell. Once the doorbell is pressed a photo is automatically taken. This photo is then forwarded to a mobile device as a push notification message with a hyperlink to the image taken of the person at your doorstep. This invention was inspired by the need to know who is ringing your doorbell, even if you\u2019re not home.</p> <p><b>What we will build</b></p> <p>We will begin by illustrating exactly how to purchase and put together the raw hardware. But software rules the world, and that\u2019s where a bulk of the presentation will focus. Once the hardware is built, we will build software that runs on the device itself, as well as software that runs in the cloud. The code will need to be able to take a picture and upload it to the cloud. From there, a push notification will need to be sent to the appropriate mobile device(s), indicating that someone has pressed the doorbell, and that the photo is available. Because of the ambitious nature of this project we will provide a number of blog posts to support the work and provide the needed details.</p> <p><b>Mono and C#\u00a0</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/f/e/600_381836062.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\nOn the Raspberry PI we will install and run Mono, which is a free and open source project led by Xamarin (formerly by Novell) that provides a .NET Framework-compatible set of tools including, among others, a C# compiler and a Common Language Runtime. The beauty of Mono is that it allows us to write .Net code compiled on Windows and run it unchanged on the Raspberry PI. In our case, we will take a photo and upload it to Windows Azure storage. We will expand the code base further, supporting the ability to send a push notifications to a Windows Phone.</p> <p><b>Node.js running in the cloud</b></p> <p>In the cloud we will work with Node.js, which will enable the PI to send photos directly to cloud storage.</p> <p><b>The Raw Hardware</b></p> <p>Getting the hardware together is really straightforward because almost all of it is available in a single Raspberry PI kit. This kit is called Canakit and can be found at <a href=\"http://www.canakit.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.canakit.com/</a>. The kit contains a few really useful things to get to get our IoT device built, including a system Board, A/C Adapter, GPIO Breakout, Bread Board, Bread Board wires, assorted resisters and LEDs. You will also need an external monitor, keyboard and mouse so you can configure and test the Raspberry PI. In addition to the Canakit, you will need two more things \u2013 a regular doorbell and a Raspberry PI compatible camera, both of which are easily purchased.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/3/a/600_381834842.jpeg\" /></p> <p>More to come...</p> <p><b>Bruno Terkaly</b></p> <p>Bruno is a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft with the objective to enable the development of industry leading applications and services across devices.\u00a0He is responsible for driving the top cloud and mobile opportunities across the United States and beyond from a technology enablement perspective.\u00a0He helps partners bring their applications to market by providing architectural guidance and deep technical engagement during the ISV\u2019s evaluation, development, and deployment.\u00a0In addition, Bruno works closely with the cloud and mobile engineering groups, providing feedback and influencing the roadmap.</p> <p><b>Steven Edouard</b></p> <p>Steven Edouard is a Developer Evangelist and full-time hacker at Microsoft.

It has never been more economical or easy for the average person to prototype and produce a consumer or commercial device manufacture and sale. For less than $100, devices like the Arduino or Raspberry Pi provides you a microcontroller fitted with a small CPU, memory, and storage. Moreover, there is a plethora of expansion boards that plug into these devices, such as motor controls, GPS, Ethernet, LCD displays, sensors, actuators and more. These tiny devices come equipped with either a proprietary operating system or GNU/Linux with up to 512MB or RAM.</p> <p>But these devices rarely have value unless they are connected to a cloud service on the backend. The cloud provides many useful services, including data analysis, issuing commands to control the device, security, provisioning, and management.</p> <p>This talk will focus on the key considerations that companies, entrepreneurs, and individuals will face when creating and supporting these devices at scale.</p> <p><b>Device Spectrum</b></p> <p>At the low end of the spectrum is the Arduino. The higher-end devices include the raspberry pi. A myriad of expansion boards can be attached to the small microcontrollers.</p> <p>What other capabilities with respect to CPU, memory, and storage?</p> <p>What expansion boards are available and what purpose do they serve?</p> <p><b>Device Software</b></p> <p>A variety of operating systems are supported on these devices. Programming tools and compilers make it possible to create custom software that run on these devices.</p> <p>What are the capabilities of these operating systems in terms of storage, memory, processing speed, and networking?</p> <p>What type of programming tools are available?</p> <p>What programming languages are supported in the device itself?</p> <p><b>Cloud Backend</b></p> <p>The cloud provides many useful services for these devices in a connected world.</p> <p>What role does the cloud play with respect to security?</p> <p>Which networking connectivity solutions that should be considered for device-to-cloud communication?</p> <p>How does the cloud help alleviate bandwidth challenges and minimize power consumption on the device?</p> <p>What are the four patterns for device to cloud service message communication?</p> <p><b>Choosing a device\u00a0</b></p> <p><i>Selecting CPU, memory, and storage</i></p> <p>At the low end of the spectrum is the Arduino with only 4K of memory. The raspberry pie represents the higher end of the spectrum, running a full-blown version of Linux.</p> <p><i>Expanding device capabilities</i></p> <p>The ability to expand your device capabilities is astounding. You can connect everything from motor controls to infrared remote control, GPS, wireless networking, home automation to sensor and beyond.</p> <p>Even if you limit yourself to look in all sensors, there is remarkable variety: Acoustic, sound, vibration, Automotive, transportation, Chemical, Electric current, electric potential, magnetic, radio, Environment, weather, moisture, humidity, Flow, fluid velocity, Ionizing radiation, subatomic particles, Navigation instruments, Position, angle, displacement, distance, speed, acceleration, Optical, light, imaging, photon, Pressure, Force, density, level, Thermal, heat, temperature, Proximity, presence</p> <p><b>Writing software for your device</b></p> <p><br/>Most of these devices come pre-equipped with some type of operating system, and support for programming tools. Many of these devices are even capable of running a Web server or supporting an external display that can provide a user interface for interaction</p> <p><br/><i>Programming tools, compilers and languages</i></p> <p><br/>Software developers work with code editors and compilers to create executables that run on the device. This presentation will provide an overview about what\u2019s available and what makes sense given specific use case scenarios. Practically all popular languages are supported on these devices. It is even possible to write code with C# on top of Mono running on Linux, for example.</p> <p><i>Client connectivity to the cloud</i></p> <p><br/>How a client device connects it to the cloud is important. Choosing an efficient communication protocol, including both networking and messaging is critical, as it affects performance, power consumption, and security.</p> <p><b>Microsoft Azure \u2013 an ideal cloud back-end for IoT devices</b></p> <p><br/>Special consideration must be given to the cloud backend. Microsoft Azure is ideally suited because of its support for the Service Bus, which provides a hosted, secure, and widely available infrastructure for widespread communication, large-scale event distribution, naming, and service publishing.</p> <p><i>Addressability and network connectivity</i></p> <p><br/>Virtual private networks fail miserably in providing a simple, efficient, and secure way to connect a client device to the cloud. Many of these devices are not under direct physical control, so making them part of a virtual network dramatically compromises security.</p> <p>Typical HTTP request response architectures drains battery life on devices. Moreover, the payload associated with the request/response payload is unnecessarily huge and can be ridiculously wasteful.</p> <p>Finally, most, if not all of these devices sit behind a network address translation layer, posing a big problem for addressability and connectivity. The Microsoft Azure Service Bus greatly simplifies connectivity acting as a relay service, and serving as a proxy for the cloud backend.</p> <p><i>Scalabilty, Storage, Big Data, Web Services<br/></i></p> <p>One of the most important aspects of the cloud is its ability to scale on demand. The amount of devices put into production is generally unknown in the beginning and can change dramatically throughout the lifecycle of the devices in the field. Having the capability to scale as needed, whether scaling up or scaling down, is critical.</p> <p>The amount of data that devices can generate staggering. Having a storage infrastructure that provides the necessary security, scale, and support for various data formats is mandatory. Microsoft Azure supports traditional blobs, key-value, column family, graph, relational, and document stores.</p> <p>The ability to analyze this data is also critically important. Support for Hadoop, reporting and data analytics is an essential part of the cloud backend. I signing probability to predictions, as well as finding patterns is an important part of the infrastructure needed to support these data producing devices.</p> <p>The cloud backend also needs to support a variety of operating systems, languages and open-source software. Microsoft Azure supports everything from Python to C#, Node.js, C/C++, as well as a variety of functional languages typically used in machine learning scenarios.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p><br/>This abstracts reflects the content that will be presented during our talk. It provides a comprehensive deep dive into the challenges and solutions for individuals and companies looking to enter the brave new world of Machine to Machine computing or the Internet of Things. The discussion will address the needs of the executive decision-makers, architects, software developers, and hardware enthusiasts. Real-life examples will be brought into the discussion as well as concrete recommendations and examples.</p>", "created": 1404172641000, "venue": {"city": "San Francisco", "name": "Microsoft", "zip": "94103", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.406745, "phone": "415738330", "state": "CA", "address_1": "835 Market St Ste 700", "country": "us", "lat": 37.785044, "id": 687180}, "updated": 1405531928000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 246, "time": 1408586400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "192272712", "name": "How to Build Your Own Internet of Things Product from the ground up-Raspberry PI"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 26.739683151245117, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Tinkering-Toms-and-Tammys-Photography-Challenge-Group/events/195421292/", "group": {"name": "Tinkering Toms - Photography Group", "group_lat": 37.790000915527344, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Toms and Tammys", "group_lon": -122.41999816894531, "urlname": "Tinkering-Toms-and-Tammys-Photography-Challenge-Group", "id": 5874872}, "description": "<p>Use blur as an element or main subject of your photograph: move the camera, zoom the lens, use a long exposure, selective focus, double-exposure (some cameras can do this), or ???</p>", "created": 1405575832000, "rsvp_limit": 10, "venue": {"city": "San Francisco", "name": "Cafe La Boheme", "zip": "94110", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.418953, "state": "CA", "address_1": "3318 24th Street", "country": "us", "lat": 37.752293, "id": 10041552}, "updated": 1405575832000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 4, "time": 1408586400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "195421292", "name": "The challenge: Blur as the Subject"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 28.477073669433594, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Hire-Android-Developers/events/190867292/", "group": {"name": "Hire Android Developers", "group_lat": 37.77000045776367, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Changemakers", "group_lon": -122.4000015258789, "urlname": "Hire-Android-Developers", "id": 15209192}, "description": "<p>Hello there,</p> <p>Join us for a fun gathering of startups looking for Android Developers and Android developers.</p> <p>Here's the run of show:</p> <p>7:00 - 7:30pm: Network</p> <p>7:30 - 8:00pm: Pitch your start-up</p> <p>8:00 - 8:30pm: Meet interested developers</p> <p>8:30+: Take over the world</p> <p>There is space for five, 5 minute pitches.</p> <p>E-mail [masked] to register.\u00a0</p> <p>Space is limited, please RSVP via Eventbrite</p> <p><a href=\"http://hireandroiddevelopers.eventbrite.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://hireandroiddevelopers.eventbrite.com</a></p> <p><br/>Important Notes:</p> <p>* Startups must offer some sort of cash compensation. * Networking with other entrepreneurs is always a good thing.</p> <p>* Talented Android app developers are still available in San Francisco.

We're informal and fun, yet, by design, we're extremely effective!</p> <p>We help people who work for a living to get a much greater payoff from working. We do this in three specific ways under our three CoreSuccess Platforms: 1) We help you move toward mastery with business-networking, 2) We help you move toward mastery with business performance, and, 3) We help you move toward mastery with personal development.</p> <p>How do we deliver on this promise to our community members? Each month we conduct dozens of business-networking meetings in more than a dozen cities in the SF Bay Area. A member may attend all of our \"OpenConnect\" business-networking meetings.\u00a0And our members are welcome and encouraged to attend any and all of these meetings and locations.</p> <p>Each month we introduce and emphasize a learning and development subject under each of our three CoreSuccess Platforms. For each of the three learning and development subjects that we introduce and emphasize each month, we give you four different ways to learn it: We produce written learning guides, video learning guides, audio learning guide, and we cover the subjects as 15-to-20-minute mini-workshops inside of our 60-minute business-networking meetings. There's no registration or initiation fee to join. Membership in GoRampUp! is month to month. You enroll when you like, even mid-month, and you depart when you like.</p> <p>Be sure to see our website to learn about\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.gorampup.com/growrampup\">our generous enrollment incentives</a></p> <p>Also, be sure to learn about our\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.gorampup.com/norisk\">100-Satisfaction Money-Back Guarantee</a></p> <p>Would you care to come to this meeting, at no cost, to see if there\u2019s business-value for you?</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http://gorampup.com/calendar\">Free-Meeting Guest-RSVP and Golden Ticket Request</a></p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http://gorampup.com/calendar\">View complete meeting details</a></p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<a href=\"http://gorampup.com/invite\">Invite a Buddy to join you</a></p> <p>One last thing: You REALLY should check out actual testimonial videos by our members:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.gorampup.com/why\">See them here</a></p> <p>This page was created to produce awareness of our event.

Marriage is a right that we should all enjoy. Enough said!</p> <p>\u2022 Obamacare becomes real and even with it's website's abysmal failure in the first months, more people sign up for insurance than anyone expected. The Republicans lose one of their basic messages \"It will never be accepted and it will never work\".\u00a0There's still room to make California a test case for single payer. Let's show the country it can work here.</p> <p>\u2022 The minimum wage is going up. \u00a0San Jose raised the minimum wage to $10.15/hr. on January 1. \u00a0Seattle just voted to raise their wage to $15/hr. Berkeley City Council just voted to raise their wage to $10/hr. It may not be a living wage or even a fair wage, but it's a good start.</p> <p>\u2022 Janet Yellen becomes chair of the Federal Reserve. The first woman to hold that post beat the odds when her supporters wouldn't budge on her nomination to the post. Her goal is to get people back to work while keeping the economy going. She's not likely to be friendly to big Federal handouts to Wall Street interests.</p> <p><br/>\u2022 This year a slate of four progressive candidates for county council, backed up by grassroots activists were elected over a business slate. Their first order of business was to kill a port expansion to ship coal to China.\u00a0Grassroots activists can and do win against the monied interests. \u00a0We have the opportunity to do that here in the East Bay this year.</p> <p><b>What opportunities and lessons learned?</b>\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<i>Turnout is key! Whether it\u2019s walking precincts, making phone calls or donating to campaigns, your personal effort at the grassroots can make the difference.</i>\u00a0</p> <p>In California we have a chance to pick up 2 of the seats the Democrats need to win back the House and see Speaker Pelosi wield the gavel again.\u00a0</p> <p>In California we are within striking distance of having a 2/3 majority in both the Senate and the Assembly that works together as a team to set the agenda and pass bills we know need to be passed.\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<i>We can support Progressive candidates across the country. DFA National is in the forefront of identifying Progressive candidates and putting resources into their elections.</i>\u00a0</p> <p>We are in the process of identifying a Congressional race in another state where we can help win two races at once. We want a Congressional race where we can turn Red to Blue and a Senate race where we are preserving a Blue seat and keep control of the Seanate.\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<i>In Colorado in 2012, we came close to defeating a Tea Party Republican in CD-06. It wasn\u2019t just inspiration that turned the voters out \u2013 rank and file union members and progressives of all sorts engaged in massive get out the vote efforts in every corner of the the district to make this happen. This year there's a strong candidate with better funding and a good track record in the State House.

As heir apparent to Love Hall, he must produce an heir of his own; but his obsessive love for his long-dead sister has rendered him a paralytic in matters of the heart. Adding to Geoffroy's troubles is his difficult mother, Lady Loveall, who mercilessly castigates her effeminate son, and a circling mob of greedy relatives anxious to wrest Love Hall from his grasp.</p> <p>Then, a miracle occurs. As his carriage passes a trash dump, Geoffroy spies an abandoned baby in the jaws of a cur. He saves the child, names her Rose, and declares her his rightful heir. The shock fells Lady Loveall on the spot, and Rose becomes the pampered daughter of Lord Loveall and his bride of convenience, the resident librarian Anonyma. This joyful period lasts until Rose's adolescence, when it becomes increasingly difficult to hide the one great secret of Love Hall: namely, that Rose, now in the position of fending off suitors for her titled hand, is in fact a boy.\u00a0</p> <p>Rose's whiskers, deepening voice, and affection for the daughter of a courtier have not gone unnoticed. Armed with the new revelation, the Loveall's unscrupulous relatives launch a coup, and a desperately confused Rose is cast adrift -- until he finds the renewed vitality that comes from the love of true family and realizes that he can and must go home.</p> <p><br/>Please join us for some good discussion and social time. Refreshments will be available. (Please feel free to bring a snack or beverage. I will supply at least one bottle of wine.)\u00a0<i>There is never any pressure to have the book completed (or read at all) in order to attend.</i>\u00a0We would just love to have you, and it can be enjoyable to hear about the book and meet some cool people.\u00a0</p> <p><i>Remember that Books, Inc. provides book club members a 15% discount on the books we are reading for the meetup.</i>\u00a0Call ahead to make sure they have a copy available for you.

There are the obvious street meters which are free at this time. In addition to these there are two outdoor lots and a parking garage in the vicinity, all of which are also free on Sundays. (Regularly $0.50/hr) The Civic Center Parking Structure is next door to the Alameda Theatre and is located at 1416 Oak Street, between Central Avenue and Santa Clara Avenue. Lot A is accessible from Park Avenue between Central avenue and Santa Clara Avenue. Lot B is accessible from both Central Avenue and Alameda Avenue between Oak Street and Park Street. The bookstore is also not too far from the Fruitvale BART Station on Oakland. It is an easy bus ride from there. Arrangements can also be made with the organizer and/or other members for rides to and from the BART.

It consists of a poster board with cut-out pictures, drawings and writing on it of the things that you want in your life or the things that you want to become.</p> <p>Supplies I Will Provide:</p> <p>Colored Markers/Poster board/Scissors/Glue/Magazines</p> <p>I have made plenty in my lifetime and without fail all my goals have come to fruition!</p> <p>The purpose of a vision board is to activate the law of attraction to begin to pull things from your external environment that will enable you to realize your dream. By selecting pictures and writing that charges your emotions with feelings of passion, you will begin to manifest those things into your life.The law of attraction states that we attract into our lives anything that we give attention to regardless whether it be positive or negative.</p> <p>Your personal vision board is only limited by the extent of your own creativity. Having artistic ability is not a prerequisite for creating a functional vision board.</p> <p>Visual. Your subconscious mind works in pictures and images, so make your vision board as visual as possible with as many pictures as you can. You can supplement your pictures with words and phrases to increase the emotional response you get from it.</p> <p>Emotional. Each picture on your vision board should evoke a positive emotional response from you. The mere sight of your vision board should make you happy and fuel your passion to achieve it every time you look at it.</p> <p>Strategically-placed. Your vision board should be strategically placed in a location that gives you maximum exposure to it. You need to constantly bath your subconscious mind with it\u2019s energy in order to manifest your desires quicker than you hope.</p> <p>Personal. Negative feelings, self-doubt, and criticism can damage the delicate energy that your vision board emits. If you fear criticism or justification of your vision board from others, then place it in a private location so it can only be seen by yourself.</p> <p>Supplies I Will Provide:</p> <p>Colored Markers/Poster board/Scissors/Glue/Magazines</p> <p>If you can, compile your pictures at home to bring into class though we will have time to do in class, as well. Start by going through your magazines and compiling all the pictures that you can find that are relevant to your goal. Don\u2019t evaluate the pictures just stack them into a pile. Make sure that each image that you will put on your board resonates with your heart and makes you excited at the mere look of it.</p> <p>It\u2019s also important when selecting pictures to include anything that is congruent with your goal, such as any changes in your life that might result from obtaining your goal. So if your goal is to have a six figure income, then select pictures of a lifestyle that is congruent with your six figure income. Asking yourself the following questions might help:</p> <p>What would you do differently when you realize your goal?<br/>Where would you travel?<br/>Where would you live?<br/>What would you wear?<br/>What things would you own?<br/>What kind of vehicle would you drive?<br/>What would you do for work? Or would you work?<br/>Who would you help?</p> <p>When the day comes to actually place your pictures onto your board don\u2019t worry about being artistic\u2014that\u2019s not the point. The point is that your board should resonate with your emotions. You should arrange your pictures in a way that gives you an emotional connection to your vision board.</p>", "created": 1375351474000, "rsvp_limit": 20, "venue": {"city": "Los Altos", "name": "Jim Flynn - State Farm Insurance Agent", "zip": "94022", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.115173, "state": "CA", "address_1": "4546 El Camino Real #4", "country": "us", "lat": 37.40065, "id": 12571632}, "updated": 1399158147000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 7, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Louise-Hay-Transformation-Group/events/132502512/", "time": 1409014800000, "duration": 14400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "132502512", "name": "Vision Board New Moon Manifesting Party Setting Your Intentions For The Year"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 28.474145889282227, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/The-Geek-Collective-of-Gamescape-SF/events/193646472/", "group": {"name": "The Geek Collective of Gamescape SF", "group_lat": 37.77000045776367, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Agents of the Collective", "group_lon": -122.44000244140625, "urlname": "The-Geek-Collective-of-Gamescape-SF", "id": 5978592}, "description": "<p>Every Monday night is Board-game nights here at the store.

Charles Ryder finds himself stationed at Brideshead, the family seat of Lord and Lady Marchmain. Exhausted by the war, he takes refuge in recalling his time spent with the heirs to the estate before the war--years spent enthralled by the beautiful but dissolute Sebastian and later in a more conventional relationship with Sebastian's sister Julia. Ryder portrays a family divided by an uncertain investment in Roman Catholicism and by their confusion over where the elite fit in the modern world.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/d/7/6/600_382147542.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Evelyn Waugh (1903-1966)</b> was born into a publishing family in Hampstead, England, and educated at Oxford.

We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company.

Within a few years Cooper had established the basic design methods that are used across the industry today and helped to popularize the notion that digital technology shouldn\u2019t terrorize its human users. In particular, his invention, design personas, are almost universally used in the field. He shared his tools, knowledge, and experience in two best-selling books, still in print and widely referenced.</p> <p>In 1988 Alan invented a dynamically extensible visual programming tool and sold it to Bill Gates, who released it to the world as Visual Basic, arguably the most successful programming language ever. This is how Alan earned the sobriquet, \u201cThe Father of Visual Basic.\u201d He started his first software company in 1976 and produced what has been called \u201cThe first serious business software for microcomputers.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Alan continues to advocate for more humane technology from his 50-acre former dairy farm in the rolling hills north of San Francisco.\u00a0</p>", "created": 1404153025000, "venue": {"city": "San Francisco", "name": "Eventbrite's New Office", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.405197, "state": "CA", "address_1": "155 5th St (7th Floor)", "country": "us", "lat": 37.782394, "id": 20179092}, "updated": 1404261865000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 87, "time": 1409187600000, "duration": 10800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "192202452", "name": "UXNight: Understanding Personas with Alan Cooper"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 28.707279205322266, "utc_offset": -25200000, "fee": {"description": "per person", "required": "1", "accepts": "paypal", "label": "Price", "currency": "USD", "amount": 49}, "group": {"name": "Women in Tech", "group_lat": 37.790000915527344, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Members", "group_lon": -122.41999816894531, "urlname": "womentech", "id": 3273522}, "description": "<p>Startup Finance: Valuation</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/2/event_100045522.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>About:</b> Learn how to value a startup.</p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core.

We will discuss some of the history of wearable computing, some examples from Jeff\u2019s doctoral research, and a rough overview of current wearable products. Jeff will also cover prototyping and research methods that are well adapted for wearable design. We will explore several futuristic product design scenarios and look at how designing for a phone app versus a wearable are different. We will also look at the trajectory of a design for certain types of capabilities and extrapolate on where the field might be going.</p> <p><b>About the Instructor:</b></p> <p>Jeff Axup, Ph.D. is an entrepreneur and UX designer.

Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art.</p> <p><br/>As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.</p> <p><br/>The Goldfinch is a novel of shocking narrative energy and power. It combines unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and breathtaking suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is a beautiful, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.</p>", "created": 1397867174000, "venue": {"city": "San Francisco", "name": "The Crepe House", "zip": "94110", "repinned": false, "lon": -122.420929, "state": "CA", "address_1": "1132 Valencia Street", "country": "us", "lat": 37.754692, "id": 3826512}, "updated": 1404269506000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 20, "time": 1409191200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "177988202", "name": "The Goldfinch (by Donna Tartt) Discussion"}, {"status": "upcoming", "distance": 8.811809539794922, "utc_offset": -25200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Doggy-Meet-Ups-at-Zoom-Room-Belmont/events/187432222/", "group": {"name": "Doggy Meet-Ups at Zoom Room Belmont!", "group_lat": 37.5099983215332, "join_mode": "open", "who": "Zoomers", "group_lon": -122.30000305175781, "urlname": "Doggy-Meet-Ups-at-Zoom-Room-Belmont", "id": 8590922}, "description": "<p>It's time for a new meetup for Small breeds who like to play and socialize!</p> <p>On Wednesday, 08/27, from 7pm to 8pm, we are hosting a Doggy Meet-Up for those up to 25lbs! $12 per dog, refreshments will be provided for the owners!
