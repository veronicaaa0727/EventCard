V<p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/0/9/4/event_209097492.jpeg" /></p> <p>This will be our guided ride (fee based) as part of the Park City week ride series. If you plan to join us for this one, RSVP now so we will have a bike count to base the fee per person on. Guide cost is $250 for 2 ppl. $75/adtl person. Total amount divided by number of riders = your cost.</p> <p><b>RIDE SUMMARY:</p> <p>\u000a\u000a</b>The Mid-Mountain Trail is a classic ride that everyone from strong intermediates to experts will enjoy. It will just take the intermediates the better part of a day. The climb up Spiro or Armstrong is a dichotomy of long and pleasant (with Spiro being the steeper of the two,) and the cross-mountain trip, while lengthy, is just pure fun. (An alternate route involves a shuttle to a starting point at Deer Valley which skips the big climb but the total length stays almost exactly the same.)</p> <p>Part of the pleasantry comes from the scenery, and one of the highlights is that virtually the whole ride is through thick aspen groves. In the summer, the shade is welcome, and in the fall you feel like you\u2019re riding through a fast changing kaleidoscope.&lt;a href="http://www.jans.com/mountain-bike-tour-mid-mountain-epic#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><img src="http://images.brandretailers.com/jans/assets/users/65239/files/images/trail-map-mid-mountain-epic.jpg" /></p> <p><b>DESCRIPTION:</p> <p>\u000a\u000a</b>The ride starts with an unrelenting 3.3 mile climb that takes you from 6900\u2019 up to 8136\u2019.  This is a long ride with a big climb at the start and you need to be in pretty good shape.  It\u2019s not recommended for your first day at altitude.  There are countless switchbacks along the way, which a solid intermediate can handle. </p> <p><b>We will use this starting point:</b> (Using the alternate starting point in Deer Valley means a climb of only about 300\u2019 and an extra 6 miles of Epic cross-mountain riding.)</p> <p>After the climb there\u2019s a pretty substantial section of rock garden which requires some intrepid riding or some patience walking, but the rest of the ride is not particularly technical, and the pay-off is more than worth it.  After working up a sweat, you are rewarded with more than 15 miles of great cross mountain single track with rolling elevations ranging from 7800\u2019 to 8300\u2019 and views of Park City, White Pine Canyon, and Snyderville Basin. Once across the Canyons Resort, the downhill is long, fast, and fun. The ride finishes with either a road and paved bike path ride back to the shop or the White Pine shuttle can come pick you up.<a href="http://www.jans.com/mountain-bike-tour-mid-mountain-epic#">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jans.com/mountain-bike-tour-mid-mountain-epic#"&gt;</a></p> <p><img src="http://images.brandretailers.com/jans/assets/users/65239/files/images/trail-chart-mid-mountain-epic.jpg" /></p> <p> </p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/b/4/event_229113972.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>Release of Liability:</b></p> <p>\u000a\u000aBy joining this group for any event, you hereby RELEASE and DISCHARGE it's owners, principals, affiliates, presenters, organizer, assistant organizer, hosts and participants from any and all liability, claims, demands or causes of action that you now have, or may have in the future, for injuries, damages, death and/or economic loss of any kind or nature, arising in whole or in part out of the activities, advice or information contained herein.

V<p>This hike has some hills, but LOTS of shade, so perfect for an August Friday hike.</p> <p>Give or take 6 miles, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours hiking time, not including drive time.</p> <p><b>We will carpool from the Springtown Golf Course Parking lot at 830am which should put us at the park by 9-915am with hopefully "friday light" traffic.</b> </p> <p>AT THE PARK MEET AT THE CANYON MEADOWS STAGING AREA, this is at the very end of the road after you enter the park.</p> <p>There can be a charge to get in the park if there is a Ranger, I have an EB parks permit so I am happy to drive. If we need more than one car, please chip in to your drive for the fee (I think around $5 total).</p> <p>There are flush toilets and water at the beginning of the hike, but bring plenty of water and maybe a snack if you like for the hike.</p> <p>We start along the lovely stream, under the Redwoods you just can't beat it.</p>

V<p><b>The Dinosaur Feather</b> by S.J. Gazan (448 pages)</p> <p><br/>Please join us for socializing anytime between 9.00 and 9.30.  The meeting begins promptly at 9.30. </p> <p><br/>We welcome your book suggestions.  Please give your recommendations to Kate G.</p> <p><br/>This from amazon.com;</p> <p>S.J. Gazan's debut novel <i>The Dinosaur Feather</i> is a classic of Scandinavian noir. With keenly observed and deeply flawed characters, this scintillating thriller uniquely employs one of the most controversial and fascinating areas of contemporary dinosaur and avian research in its diabolical twists. <i>The Dinosaur Feather</i> has been published in more than a dozen countries and won the Danish Crime Novel of the Decade Award. The<i> Financial Times</i> called it \u201ca top-flight thriller\u2014smart and outrageously entertaining.<br/> \u000aBiology postgraduate, PhD hopeful, and single mom Anna Bella Nor is just two weeks away from defending her thesis on the saurian origin of birds when her academic supervisor, the highly respected yet widely despised Dr. Lars Helland, is found dead in his office chair at the University of Copenhagen. The police discover a copy of Anna\u2019s thesis in the dead man\u2019s bloody lap. </p> <p>When the autopsy suggests that Helland was murdered in a fiendishly ingenious way, brilliant but tormented young Police Superintendent Søren Marhauge begins the daunting task of unraveling the knotted skeins of interpersonal and intellectual intrigue among the scientists at the university.</p> <p>Everyone involved with the investigation\u2014 from Anna Bella Nor to Helland\u2019s numerous rivals to Marhauge\u2019s own ex-wife, who is pregnant with her current husband\u2019s child\u2014 has something to hide, complicating the investigation and presenting the detective with the greatest professional and personal challenge of his career.</p>

V<p>At home I like to set up some types of creative provocation for Leena to discover and enjoy. Recently we've been using nature to paint with (pinecones, tree branches, leaves, flowers, sticks instead of traditional paintbrushes). It's been so fun incorporating nature play into a sensory experience. I'd love to set up this simple activity at the park for other toddlers to enjoy too. I'll bring all the materials, and you're welcome to bring bits of nature that you've found also. This may get messy - I recommend bringing an extra change of clothes too.</p> <p>Hope to see your little artists there!</p>

Even after an \u201cUh huh\u201d came right out of his mouth?</p> <p>Sometimes it\u2019s challenging to get through to men.

If you cancel in less than 24 hours, it will be treated like a No Show, in addition to losing the fee.  After three No Shows you will be asked to no longer RSVP.  You may attend as a guest of someone in the group who has RSVPd and indicated they are bringing a guest.  We hope this is reasonable. We're trying to be considerate of everyone who genuinely wants to attend.</p> <p>Attendees are requested to be mindful at all times of their own personal emotional well being and the care and support of others in the group. If you have concerns about your own ability to remain emotionally and psychologically well in a group where deep life issues are being addressed we urge you to seek professional medical or psychological care. The group facilitators, while experienced healers and coaches, are not acting as licensed healthcare professionals and cannot be responsible for your personal care in a meetup group setting.</p>

V<p>Hi all,</p> <p>First Friday Happy Hour/Movie Night again! People can come for drinks/food, or meet us at the movies, or come for both.  I list the movie choices and times as the date gets close.  We don't all have to see the same movie :) Applebee's has great happy hour food and drink prices - which do end at 6, but the regular menu's very reasonable, too.  It's a short drive (or even a good walk) over to Pacific Commons for the movie. </p> <p><br/>This is a casual, stress-free event.  It's Friday!  I don't care whether you arrive at 5:30 or 6-ish (please don't be scared off by the 5:30 start time), but do NOT be a no-show or a party-crasher, because that affects our reservations and Applebee's has been really good to us.  They're happy to seat the first few to arrive and let the rest seat as they get there, plus they do separate checks so late arrivals don't affect anyone else.  </p> <p><br/>It's been a nice monthly thing we have going :)  See y'all at the next one! </p> <p><br/>Erin</p>

V<p>PLEASE NOTE: This is not a workshop.</p> <p>COST: free</p> <p><br/>In the next couple of weeks I'll be co-leading an experimental Tarot and Art school in West Marin. The culmination of the project will take place at Krowswork Gallery on August 1st! Come out for free Tarot readings by the students, meditations and art!</p> <p>"The Golden Dome is a nomadic school dedicated to investigating intentional living and art as it relates to cultivating ideas for sustaining and optimizing life on Earth. Each school session takes a figure from the Major Arcana as it's central theme, and focuses on the study of the spiritual dimensions within the natural sciences and the expansion of these insights into the physical art practice.</p> <p>Our first program, 'Performing the Fool's Planetary Rites", takes place at a sustainable land art project in West Marin and centers around the study of the Tarot and it's relationship to performance.</p> <p>The Golden Dome will take residence at Krowswork gallery offering performances, meditations, and tarot healing sessions for Oakland's First Friday on August 1st, 2014. The life and work of Eliza Swann and Laura Zuspan will also be featured." -E. Swann</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/9/e/6/600_385615782.jpeg" /></p> <p>ALSO: MY SUMMER HEALING PACKAGE</p> <p>For the summer season I\u2019m offering a special 2 month package consisting of one 60-min Tarot Reading and two follow up 90-minute Intuitive Coaching &amp; Tarot Readings for only $195. This is a $90 savings.</p> <p>The first 60-min session is designed to illuminate your current life story, where you\u2019re headed and what your potential life purpose is revealing. From this first session I\u2019ll assign homework and recommend readings. The following two sessions will be a hybrid of intuitive coaching -maintaining your success vision, the strategy to get there and your mindset coupled with relaxation techniques and a ceremonial Tarot Reading/Healing to help encapsulate the previous days/weeks work. This program has empowered and inspired many clients and jumped started change, flow and a general sense of purpose.</p> <p>Please feel free to set up a phone consultation to answer any questions you might have on the program @ <a href="mailto:[masked]">[masked]</a></p> <p>\u201cSometimes our hearts need to open to the realm of new possibilities. Sometimes the path in front of us is hidden by distractions. Shift is inevitable. Laura is deeply intuitive and can hold space as your cards unfold.  She engages without judgment, patiently listens while we learn and sends us home feeling light, calm and clear.\u201d</p> <p>-Hannah Weiss, Midwife in Oakland</p> <p>\u2018Laura\u2019s reading\u2019s are empowering and intuitive. I would recommend her to anyone, whether you have a specific question or are simply looking for insight and perspective.\u2019 </p> <p>-Jessica N, Artist in Oakland</p>

V<p>Newly opened and fantastic!  Amit and Badma are the husband (chef) and wife (host) owners of this Punjabi style Indian restaurant just off Backesto Park, at 13th and Empire, downtown San Jose. Since it opened, it has been getting rave reviews, including from me. The ambience and service are both top notch, as well as the food, which is fresh and fragrant, with halal meats. Vegetarian options are available as well. They don't yet have their own website, but you can check out the reviews on Yelp. It's a small place, so for this time out, I'm setting a limit of 12. </p>

V<p>We\u2019ve all had times when life has felt effortless and ON. Maybe we\u2019ve felt it in work, or in art, or in sex. The problem is that most of us spend our lives grasping for this state with no clear way to get back, maybe we fall back into our familiar patterns. Some never wake up - it\u2019s 2014 and it feels like 2012 was just yesterday. The antidote to this is total immersion \u2013 total immersion into your life, and total immersion into your relationships. And you can have it. It just takes a life or death attitude. That\u2019s what you can expect from experts Nicole Daedone and Steven Kotler. Nicole and Steven both credit orgasm and flow with saving their lives, and are now widely recognized as the top experts on how to have orgasm and flow in your life.</p> <p>This weekend is an opportunity to be on the front lines of this work. You\u2019ll be put into experiential learning where you can learn not just the theory of what it means to live a life of total immersion \u2013 you\u2019ll get both the nuts and bolts, and you\u2019ll actually be in flow and orgasm this weekend, which research has shown increases learning by 5x. Benefits Spend a weekend in flow and orgasm (not your normal vacation) Hands on experiential learning into how to reproduce flow and achieve optimal states of performance In depth training on orgasmic meditation from Nicole Daedone; learn how to elevate sex to an art and a craft Achieve 5x learning potential, accelerate your path to mastery.</p> <p>Be among the first in the world to get expert level training in both of these arenas; take optimal living into your life and into your relationships.</p> <p><b>Faculty</b></p> <p>Nicole Daedone is the author of Slow Sex: The Art and Craft of the Female Orgasm (Grand Central/Hachette, May 2011) and is the founder of OneTaste, a company that offers training in orgasm, sex, and man-woman relating through online media and in-person coaching and courses. The practice at the heart of her work is called OM or Orgasmic Meditation.</p> <p>Steven Kotler is a New York Times bestselling author, award-winning journalist, and cofounder and director of research for the Flow Genome Project. His work has been translated into thirty languages and his articles have appeared in more than seventy publications, including New York Times Magazine, Atlantic Monthly, Wired, and Forbes</p> <p><b>For questions feel free to contact Eli Block</b></p> <p>[masked]</p> <p>[masked]</p>

V<p>We play and teach games all night long until midnight.  Drop in any time from 7:00 to 11:00 or so and you're sure to find something to play!  Bring your games from home or use any of the games from our extensive used game library.  We often have many tables going on at once for lots of variety.  The earlier part of the evening is ideal for families with kids.</p> <p>We play all sorts of board games and card games on Friday nights, but also:</p> <p>Got a <b>favorite game</b> you'd like to find others to play? Bring it along!  Let us know in advance if possible so we can help with recruiting players.</p> <p>Our <b>chess</b> and <b>Go</b> guru Steve Bloom is often on hand to teach and play both, and will always confirm here if he's coming.  (Plus we have a separate Meetup for each every Sunday; for details see chess <a href="http://www.meetup.com/North-Oakland-Chess-Club/">here</a> and Go <a href="http://www.meetup.com/North-Oakland-Go-Club/">here</a>.)</p> <p>Very recently we've added <b>Magic the Gathering</b> every Friday (reserved table in the back) and on Thursdays too, hosted by Jimmy Freeman and both starting at 7:00 PM.  See our separate <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Magic-the-Gathering-we-are-a-community-of-MTG-players/">MTG Meetup page</a> for details on these plus special MTG events. </p> <p>(We have had to drop our 2nd/4th Friday Pathfinder Beginner's Box offering for the time being due to the rapidly advancing pregnancy of the GM's wife -- congrats to both!  For now, check out our separate Pathfinder Society Meetup, held every Wednesday, <a href="https://warhorn.net/events/its-your-move-pfs">here</a>.)</p> <p>In addition to these Friday Meetups and the ones linked above, there are yet more game-specific events for adults and youth over the course of each week, including <b>Scrabble</b>, youth Pathfinder, youth chess and youth Go classes/play, so check out our full schedule <a href="http://www.meetup.com/oaklandgames/pages/Event_schedule/">here</a>. There's more to come, so be sure to stay in touch!</p> <p>We request a donation of $3 to help offset the cost of keeping the store open so late every Friday.</p> <p>Hope to see you soon!</p> <p>-- Chris Specker and Will Kreber (owner/managers)</p>

V<p>&lt;b style="font-size : 16px"&gt;Speaker: Vlad Ureche, EPFL</b></p> <p>&lt;b style="font-size : 16px"&gt;Title: What do autoboxing, value classes and specialization have in common?</b></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<b>Description:</b></p> <p>Would you answer "a lot"? In this talk, Vlad will present a theory that unifies autoboxing, value classes, specialization and staging in a single transformation mechanism. This theory has been successfully used to implement three program transformations: miniboxing specialization (<a href="http://scala-miniboxing.org/">scala-miniboxing.org</a>), multi-parameter value classes (<a href="http://github.com/miniboxing/value-plugin/wiki">github.com/miniboxing/value-plugin/wiki</a>) and staging (<a href="http://github.com/miniboxing/staging-plugin/wiki">github.com/miniboxing/staging-plugin/wiki</a>).</p> <p>The aim of all these transformations is to replace the data representation of certain objects in the program without altering the semantics. For example, we may want to unbox \u201cscala.Int\u201d to Java\u2019s more efficient \u201cint\u201d representation whenever possible, to avoid the overhead of heap objects. However, unboxing even a single method parameter requires adapting all its callers plus the method\u2019s body. This makes it very hard to transform a program without introducing inconsistencies.</p> <p>Yet, tracking the data representation in the type allows us to add coercions between representations in an automatic, reliable and optimal way. This mechanism can later be customized to unbox primitive types, inline value classes, to perform specialization, to optimize closures or to allow multi-stage programming, which peels away the abstraction layers slowing down high-level code. Now, the question is: what\u2019s YOUR use case for the transformation mechanism?</p> <p>&lt;b style="font-size : 16px"&gt;Speaker's short bio.</b></p> <p>Vlad is a PhD student in the Scala Lab at EPFL, where he's working on optimizing high-level patterns in the Scala programming language down to fast JVM bytecode. His main project, miniboxing (<a href="http://scala-miniboxing.org/">scala-miniboxing.org</a>), is aimed at compiling generic classes down to very efficient bytecode.&lt;b style="font-size : 16px"&gt;<br/></b></p> <p>\u000a\u000a<b>Schedule</b></p> <p>\u2022 6:30-7:00 - networking</p> <p>\u2022 7:00-7:10 - announcements etc</p> <p>\u2022 7:10-~8:40 - talk</p> <p>\u2022 8:40-9:00 - networking</p>

The ABC's that set the groundwork for continued expansion and well-being on the channeling path will be an important part of our work together. As a group, you will witness and support each other in the intensive process of becoming a clear and open channel. The individual process is honored and each attendee will receive personalized assistance and training.</p> <p>At the completion of this course, you will be invited to join (FREE!) our channeling support community and receive ongoing support with your channeling.  It is a rockin' community filled with amazing healers and channels.</p> <p>** Intermediate studies and advanced channeling studies offered throughout the year. Beginning channeling is a pre-requisite for these courses.</p> <p>Because of the personalized nature of this training, the class size will be limited to 10 people. These classes fill quickly!</p> <p>TO REGISTER PLEASE CONTACT WENDY GAYLE AT [masked] or e-mail <a href="mailto:[masked]">[masked]</a>.</p> <p>Course cost: $250.00 ~ DEPOSIT $50.00 AT REGISTRATION</p> <p>**If you would like to connect with past students about their experiences, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

V<p>We\u2019ve all had times when life has felt effortless and ON. Maybe we\u2019ve felt it in work, or in art, or in sex. The problem is that most of us spend our lives grasping for this state with no clear way to get back, maybe we fall back into our familiar patterns. Some never wake up - it\u2019s 2014 and it feels like 2012 was just yesterday. The antidote to this is total immersion \u2013 total immersion into your life, and total immersion into your relationships. And you can have it. It just takes a life or death attitude. That\u2019s what you can expect from experts Nicole Daedone and Steven Kotler. Nicole and Steven both credit orgasm and flow with saving their lives, and are now widely recognized as the top experts on how to have orgasm and flow in your life.</p> <p>This weekend is an opportunity to be on the front lines of this work. You\u2019ll be put into experiential learning where you can learn not just the theory of what it means to live a life of total immersion \u2013 you\u2019ll get both the nuts and bolts, and you\u2019ll actually be in flow and orgasm this weekend, which research has shown increases learning by 5x.

Please note that Main Street will be blocked off for the movie, so I suggest looking for parking on 2nd or 3rd streets.</p> <p>Bring: - A camping chair. I recommend camping chairs rather than low beach chairs so that you can see over everyone's heads. - Blanket and jacket</p> <p>- $ for pizza. If there's interest, I'll order a few pizzas to share</p> <p><a href="http://www.downtownlosaltos.org/events/fmn.html" class="linkified">http://www.downtownlosaltos.org/events/fmn.html</a></p>

V<p>House of Air is a ginormous trampoline park built in an historic airplane hangar out in Chrissy Field. We have an amazing time playing trampoline dodgeball every time we go. Friday nights after 8pm are adults only.</p> <p>We'll be playing from <b>8 to 9pm</b>. Please try to get there 15 minutes beforehand to prepare, change, and do quick intros. After dodgeball ends we can do official intros and grab some food and drink at Pizza Orgasmica (823 Clement St. between 9th/10th) in the Richmond district.</p> <p>I recommend you buy your <a href="https://houseofair.secure.force.com/Booking?pid=01t80000003HhKYAA0">tickets online</a> because sometimes this time slot will sell out.</p> <p>House of Air has free lockers and bathrooms if you want to bring a change of clothes.</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>-Kees</p>

For extra fun, get a ticket to the pre-concert dinner at 6:30.</p> <p>Read about the opening night concert here:</p> <p><br/><a href="http://cabrillomusic.org/performance/2014/play/"><a href="http://cabrillomusic.org/performance/2014/play/" class="linkified">http://cabrillomusic.org/performance/2014/play/</a></a></p> <p><br/>Sadly, I have to miss opening night this year. I'm hoping one of our assistant organizers can step in. I'll post something as soon as I hear from them. Meanwhile, get your ticket before this concert sells out! Plan to attend and have a great time with other members of our meetup.</p> <p>~ Gerry</p>

V<p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/1/e/4/600_383352772.jpeg" /></p> <p>Join Yalla Arabi for an enchanting evening combining theater and live Arabic music based on the stories of "The Arabian Nights." (Alf Layla we Layla).  An Improvised "Arabian Nights" will tell stories in the style of Shahrazad <br/>of magic, heroes and wanderers.</p> <p><b>An Improvised "Arabian Nights" Directed by Basel Al-Naffouri and Music by Joshua Raoul Brody and the Aswat Ensemble<br/>Friday, August 1 @ 8:00 pm<br/>Stage Werx, 446 Valencia St, San Francisco, California 94103<br/>Ticket Prices: $20 (general) and $25 (VIP). Note there is a small service charge when you purchase your ticket online)<br/>For tickets, visit: <a href="http://improvarabiannights.bpt.me/"><a href="http://improvarabiannights.bpt.me/" class="linkified">http://improvarabiannights.bpt.me/</a></a><br/></b></p> <p>An Improvised "Arabian Nights" is a *long-form improv performance brought to you by some of the Bay Area's most celebrated improvisers and classical Arabic musicians from the ASWAT ensemble. Our heroes and heroines inhabit an exciting world filled with genies, robbers, viziers, magical creatures, kings, princesses, demons, fishermen, merchants, ghouls and more. </p> <p>Each evening's show is created entirely in the moment without any script. Actors create stories on the spot, ranging from 20-90 minutes in length. Though completely improvised, performances display well-acted narrative arcs similar to that of scripted movies and plays.</p> <p>NOTE: The show will be performed on Friday, August 1 and on Saturday, August 2. Each night will be new and completely different from the one before. </p> <p>Stage Werx, which is located at 466 Valencia Street in San Francisco's Mission District, is a few blocks away from the 16th Street BART station. Street parking in that neighborhood can be difficult so car pooling and public transportation is recommended.</p> <p>There are also a lot of affordable restaurants in the Mission District, which are close to the theater. </p> <p>I will update the invitation if I can find a suitable place to meet before or after the show. </p>

Any one of the Detroit-raised artist's DJ sets or productions breeds a rare feel of mystique and discovery. "I'm really obsessed with finding a line between things - between sounds and between genres. My influences come from a life spent in very different environments, which plays a huge role in the way I connect with music."</p> <p>Dramatic sounds and eccentric basslines carry her multilayered sound, which veers everywhere from funked-out space disco to the intricately-programmed, metallic feel of Detroit to stripped down techno, all the way to Italian horror film soundtracks. The only thing that remains consistent is the element of surprise.</p> <p>Her accidental entry into Detroit's underground party scene as a teenager was the kick-start she needed for a lifelong love affair. Soon all became a blur of "cities, record stores, and parties." In 1998, she joined Minus and began touring the world as Richie Hawtin's sole opener. From there, her distinctive sound began to develop and the rest is history.</p> <p>Stylistically, Magda grooves through opposition - creating sets that are emotion-led yet clinical, having profound expertise with analog and digital technology. Her sound is otherworldly but visceral; dark with a warm sense of beauty and grace; sparse yet wondrously full-bodied with density and bass-swathed extremes. Magda's DJing style has been encapsulated on her mixed CDs 'She's A Dancing Machine,' and her mix for London club Fabric 'Fabric 49' (a mix CD with as much artistry and vision as an original album).</p> <p>In the fall of 2010, Magda revealed her debut, 'From The Fallen Page,' a darkly- tinged, transportive album that curiously combines natural, organic sounds, and modern electronic grace. Similar to her unpredictable DJ sets, 'From The Fallen Page' took listeners from one end of the spectrum to the other, treading the fine lines of extremities along the way.</p> <p>These days Magda isn't home very often. In-between touring, she's fully focused on her recently resurrected label 'Items &amp; Things.' The label's vision always pinpoints the off-kilter and the uncommon, seeking out new artists and sounds that push boundaries. "Items and things are bits and pieces of uniqueness we come across. The label is a platform to launch the music that we love. There are no rules, just sounds we like and artists we believe in."</p> <p>VINCENZO BIO:</p> <p>An artist who has such talent, style and longevity is a rare creature nowadays... and Italo\u2010German Vincenzo Ragone, known to the House world as Vincenzo, is indeed one of these special creatures! Hard to track down and often a man of the night, Ragone has been casting his deep and truly one\u2010of\u2010a\u2010kind takes on House and Techno out into the ether for well over a decade. Vincenzo was a true child of the Acid House explosion, and one of an original cast of Hamburg based Djs and Producers, hanging out and collaborating with friends who would later become some of the trend setting icons of the present \u2010 notably Poker Flat's future ringmaster Steve Bug offered him some crucial gigs at the revered 'Reduced' parties at Hamburg's 'Front' Club! From here on the star in the making went on to produce his first ever productions for the Raw Elements label, alongside Sandro Catallo in 1995, and then released his first ever solo tracks with the label in '97. His production energies began to draw him further and further into this magical music, which knew no bounds, and in 1998 Vincenzo released his debut album, the classic '1\u2010800\u2010Vincenzo,' on none other than the newly blossoming Dessous Imprint to great International applause. Numerous solo and collaborative releases followed, notching up studio time in New York with Alexi Delano (aka A.D.N.Y), leading to the A.D.N.Y &amp; Vincenzo project. Clearly picking up a heavy dose of those soulful, US House flavours that would never wash away... His year spent living in New York proved Vincenzo had real International appeal, and increased touring to play gigs in House Clubs stateside, as well as globally, confirmed this musical passion was meant to be. His relationship with the funky yet stripped, Deep House movement continued through his enigmatic 'Strip Joint Grooves' series on Dessous, and also through further collaborations with San Francisco's Dj Rasoul, Nottingham's John Buckby aka Schmoov, Marc Schneider (aka Snider) and many, many more. Indeed his name and musical offerings continued to elevate and inspire, and recent releases and remixes on Dessous and Hamburg's Liebe*Detail records suggested a more mature, techy sound had sprouted from the seasoned house\u2010head's mixing desk. 2007's notable remix for the Liebe*Detail offshoot label 'Spezial', a stunning re\u2010think of a Move\u2010D modern classic, 'Anne Will', won him notoriety for effortlessly transcending both the Deep House and Minimal Techno worlds.... creating a reduced beach party track that also had the power to deeply rock the clubs! Vincenzo racked\u2010up a serious amount of air miles over his long and busy career (and he continues to do so!) He has worked with some of the most important producers and labels within his field of expertise, yet he maintains a humble existence, not wanting to over \u2010play his part in the grand scheme of things. In fact, he shouldn't be so humble, as his records, both old and new, are consistently played and charted by a spectrum of Djs that most producers could only dream of... No surprise then that his most recent EP \u0301s for Pokerflat,Freerange and his own new imprint Teardrop picked up big support from steve bug,laurent garnier,josh wink,ian pooley and sasse.only to name a few: proof once more that this traditionally\u2010underground impresario of House is here to stay, and continues to share his unique sound with the world.</p>

There are a few parking spaces right at the corner, plenty more half a block away in the bigger lot off Olympic Blvd near Pleasant Hill Road. We'll run out and back, so you can run as far as 14 miles. But most of us will turn around at the Community Center (where there are rest rooms) for a 6-mile round trip. Going out, it's slightly uphill, so it's easy to run reverse splits.</p>

V<p>This class is such a hard workout, but it is so much fun! You'll be surprised how tired you can get from jumping on a trampoline. The class is 50 minutes long, and begins at 9:00 am. Please arrive about 15 minutes early, to make sure you have time to sign up &amp; pay before the class begins. The cost is $7 per person (or you can purchase 10 classes for $50). You must either jump barefoot, or purchase the $2 grip socks. See you there! :)</p>

V<p>Berkeley, California.</p> <p>The second annual Effective Altruism Summit will take place from July 27- August 2. We are now accepting applications through the Summit website: <a href="http://www.effectivealtruismsummit.com">www.effectivealtruismsummit.com</a></p> <p>Effective altruism is a growing intellectual movement that uses evidence and reason to identify the most effective ways of improving the world. This approach often involves reframing the problem in order to get at less conventional and less obvious solutions. For example, if you want to improve the lives of the poor, society tells you to do something like join the Peace Corps. But in fact it may be more effective to work on Wall Street for two years, earn hundreds of thousands of dollars, and give most of it to a charity proven to save lives.</p> <p>The Summit is largest annual gathering of the effective altruism movement. This year\u2019s conference will be in two parts: a 5-day retreat for committed effective altruists looking to hone their strategy skills and make connections with like-minded people, and a 2-day conference for anyone interested in learning more about effective altruism and being part of the largest annual gathering of the community. The weekend conference will be a mixture of presentations, interactive workshops and social time. Speakers include:<br/> \u000aPeter Thiel, Thiel Foundation, co-founder of PayPal<br/>Holden Karnofsky, co-founder of Givewell<br/>Max Tegmark, co-founder of the Future of Life Institute, professor at MIT<br/> </p> <p>Members of the following organizations will be in attendance: Machine Intelligence Research Institute; GiveWell; Centre for Effective Altruism; 80,000 Hours; Giving What We Can Center for Applied Rationality &amp; Leverage Research.</p> <p>You should apply if:<br/>you want to be part of the largest collection of people trying to improve the world in a strategic way<br/>you work at an NGO or charity and feel dissatisfied with the size of your impact<br/>you want to improve the world and feel discouraged by the current options<br/>you\u2019re willing to look beyond simplistic solutions to figure out how the world really works<br/>you want to apply more rigorous methods of evaluation to your current projects<br/>you want to know how to select your next project</p> <p>Financial aid is available. Inquire through the website or here: [masked]</p>

V<p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/3/3/0/600_343125872.jpeg" /></p> <p>Please join me for an easy 5-mile hike at Angel Island! We will follow dirt paths and fire trails (there are some stairs) to go around the island and then hike up to the top of Mt. Livermore (about 700 ft elevation change).</p> <p><br/>Let's meet at the Angel Island-Tiburon Ferry terminal at 9:30 am. The fare is $13.50. Cash, checks and credit cards are accepted...cash is easiest though! The ferry leaves at 10 am.</p> <p><br/>This is a fun hike that offers unique views of San Francisco, Marin, and the East Bay. Once at the top of Mt. Livermore we will stop for lunch and then return along the same trails to the ferry terminal. The ferry leaves Angel Island for Tiburon at 20 minutes past the hour. The last ferry leaves at 4:20 pm.</p> <p><br/>Once we are back on the mainland we will stop at Guyamas for margaritas and snacks/dinner.</p> <p>Hope to see you there!</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/0/4/2/600_343125122.jpeg" /></p>

V<p>Let's take a hike through the Presidio. It's a beautiful time of year- everything is green, and the park comes alive.</p> <p>We'll meet at the Inn at The Presidio, and head over to the Ecology Trail. We'll follow the trail past the vista point to the Paul Goode Field, and the West Pacific Grove path. From there, we walk over to the Goldsworthy TREELINE installation- our pups become part of the artwork!. The installation follows Lover's Lane, and a connector path will take us back towards the Main Post to our starting point. I reckon this walk will take an hour and a half or so, depending on how much we dilly-dally. There will be plenty of places for our dogs to stop and have a romping game of chase (either each other, a toy, or their tail. Whatever works).</p> <p>There's paid parking at the lot attached to the Main Post, and free parking at various spots throughout the Presidio.  Muni bus #43 lands about 5 minutes away.</p> <p>Rain cancels</p>

V<p>Want to try Steampunk? Jewish geek Valerie Frankel has plenty of costumes to loan out if you want to try on a military cap, mini top hat, or even a real corset (and take loads of awesome pics)! Join her, her dad the Tesla Officer on the Airship Albatross, and some genuine local Steampunkers to see this Bay Area treasure. We\u2019ll have a tour of the museum and docent-led lecture on history of airships plus airship dress and uniforms. Any costumes are appreciated, from Victorian sundresses to leather jackets or vests. Normal clothes are perfectly acceptable.<br/>We will provide light refreshments. You can bring a lunch and can eat in the meeting room if you wish. Cost $10 per person including refreshments. [Please note: This activity takes place right smack-dab in the middle of Shabbos.  We don't usually plan activities on Saturdays but for Valerie we will make an exception.] ;)</p>

V<p>Here's to our first fundraiser for the new Rotaract year! Our job is to be in charge of the ice-cream carts at the Art and Wine Festival! There will be a total of 2 shifts per day. You are more than welcome to work both shifts or just one. August 2nd: 10-2PM and 2-6PM<br/>August 3rd: 10-2 PM and 2-6PM</p> <p>Don't worry! There will be two people handling per cart so you won't be alone. Be sure to bring a hat and/or sunscreen as it gets pretty warm and we don't want you to get sunburnt. The proceeds from the ice-cream carts will go towards the club's funds so we can support local and international service projects. More details will come as the time comes near. Hope to see many sign ups! The more people we get the more ice-cream carts they will give us. Please comment below on which shifts  you will be able to attend. </p>

V<p><b>Let's meet for a quick fun walk for a exercise before it gets too hot.</b>  We are meeting at the <b>Starbucks on Santa Cruz Ave</b> (NOT the one next to Safeway) at Highway 9 where there's plenty of parking spots on <b>Saturday, June 28, 10 AM,</b> then we'll walk through a nice quaint residential area to the trail entrance off of Roberts.  </p> <p>*** <b>Getting to the downtown Los Gatos, avoid taking 880 after Hamilton Exit on</b>, as it'll be jammed with the beach goers. <b> Instead, take Winchester</b> <b>or Bascom</b> <b>into Los Gatos</b>.</p> <p>** <b>RSVP</b> if you plan to join the walk.  Join us even if you didn't RSVP.  <b>NO need to RSVP "NO</b>" if you're not attending.</p> <p>The nice flat trail from <b>downtown Los Gatos to Vasona Lake County Park</b> is a very pleasant 1.1 mile, 20-minute walk along the creek on a flat paved trail.  Since the the trail to/from the Vasona Park is mostly shaded by the trees, you won't feel overheated even on a hot summer day.  </p> <p>We can add more miles by walking along the scenic lake a bit, so we can make this a moderate 3-mile stroll of 1 hour.  </p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/1/9/c/600_319820892.jpeg" /></p> <p>Bring a bottle of water, sun screen, hat, layer of clothing to adjust for the warmer/cooler weather.</p> <p>Moderate to heavy rain cancels.  </p>

V<p>As an Android developer, do you wish you could solve the issues on your own?   Does seeing cryptic error messages from the compiler or IDE want to make you run for hills?   Do you wonder if you're the only one who spends hours trying to get your apps to run?</p> <p>This workshop is geared for Android beginners <b>who have already built one basic Android app</b> who want to develop or enhance their debugging skills.  You must have Eclipse or Android Studio along with a working Android emulator installed.</p> <p>In this workshop, we'll also talk about some of the approaches and mentality you'll need to have to troubleshoot your own code.  We will go through a few exercises in which you will have to fix issues in intentionally broken Android programs.  We hope this workshop will allow you to feel more self-sufficient and capable at uncovering the issues in your own Android programs.  </p> <p>Please make sure to bring your own laptop and power cable.  WiFi and power will be provided.   You must signup and be on the final list in order for security to permit you in the building.</p> <p>The event will be led by instructors Ari Lacenski and Roger Hu. Two other teaching assistants will be helping out as well!  <b>Coffee, Breakfast and lunch will be provided.</b></p> <p><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:[masked]">[masked]</a> if you have any questions. Look forward to seeing you all there!</p>

V<p>This is one of my regular spots. They used to be located in the Danville Hotel on Hartz Ave, but moved to a new location across the street from Trader Joe's. The new location is much larger and retains a lot of the indoor mixed with outdoor atmosphere the old location had. Even though it lost the patio that overlooked all the pedestrians walking up and down Hartz, I think they did a good job with the new place to retain the character. </p> <p>NEW THIS EVENT: We will have a donation box for $1 per person showing up. The donation will fund name tags, flag stickers if I find them, and as a fund to secure future venues for BBQs, Pot Lucks, wine tasting etc.... This was a suggestion by a member to improve the cross socializing, and start adding different types of events. All good ideas deserve a chance :)</p> <p>On the weekends they serve Beignets with raspberry sauce. Not quite Cafe Du Monde in new Orleans, but good. They also have a good breakfast menu.</p> <p>They serve Blue Bottle coffee (based in Oakland), which is one of the gourmet brewed one cup at a time brands. If you stay for lunch, I think their hamburger is one of the best in the area. </p> <p>The place is popular,  but they have more space at the new location so I will expand the limit to 20, and we can test how that goes. </p> <p>The new Location is approximately a block from the Iron Horse Trails for those of you interested in hiking/biking before or after. </p> <p>The format for Coffee is the same. Come when you please and leave when you please, making this a good on the way spot if you are driving up or down 680 that day, or live close to Danville. For the rest of us, this is a great place to start our day. Hope to see you there.</p>

We'll set another date, no prob.</p> <p>Smell ya' later. :3</p>

V<p><i><b><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/0/9/4/event_209097492.jpeg" /></b></i></p> <p>We will meet at <b>10:30 AM</b>. Shuttle will roll at <b>11:00 AM</b> even if you are not present. If you have a Yes RSVP on July 18th, you will be required to pay for your shuttle spot. All shuttle spots are being held for our group but must be paid for by each participant individually. <b>Call [masked] to pay for your shuttle spot.</b> The cost is $15. Please give them your name and <b>tell them that you are with South Bay Mountain Bike Group</b>. If you do not pay by July 18th you may loose your spot on the shuttle!</p> <p><b>Ride Description:</b></p> <p><b>Mt. Rose to Marlette Lake via the Flume Trail:</b></p> <p><b>950 feet of climbing. 20 miles</b></p> <p><b>Pack a lunch! We will eat at Marlette Lake.</b></p> <p>The beginning of this beautiful section of the Tahoe Rim Trail is at 8700' above the Sheep Flats (aka Tahoe Meadows) on the Mt. Rose Highway above Incline Village.</p> <p><br/>It is often quite cool in the morning at the shuttle drop off site so bring a wind shell to start the ride. The first part of the trail parallels the highway and then descends through the meadows and briefly joins the Ophir Creek trail.</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/b/4/event_229113972.jpeg" /></p> <p>After a 300' climb out of the meadows (the biggest climb until you reach the Tunnel Creek road) you begin to contour your way to the Tunnel Creek road. There are many great vistas of Lake Tahoe as well as Washoe Lake in Nevada. The contrast between the Tahoe basin and the Great basin is startling. There are many small climbs and descents along the route toward the Tunnel Creek road in the Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park. This section is moderately technical due to the many solo rock steps. Lofting your front wheel over the steps is a very useful skill to have in your quiver.</p> <p><b>At about nine miles,</b> you will come to the Tunnel Creek Road (8000'). Down this road to the right a half a mile brings you to the North end of the Flume Trail. The views on the Flume trail are awesome. It is truly one of the best trails to get views of Lake Tahoe.</p> <p>As you ride the Flume Trail it will take you past Marlette Lake. The ride will then head back along the Flume Trail to Tunnel Creek Road. Yes, you will be doing the Flume Trail twice. At the intersection at Tunnel Creek Road, it will be truly all downhill back to the cafe parking area. The road down is very sandy in places so watch your speed. Please smile and say hi to all trail users.</p> <p><a href="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/a/2/highres_138021922.jpeg">&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>&lt;a href="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/a/2/highres_138021922.jpeg" target="_blank"&gt;</a></p> <p><a href="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/a/2/highres_138021922.jpeg">&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>&lt;a href="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/a/2/highres_138021922.jpeg" target="_blank"&gt;<img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/a/2/600_138021922.jpeg" /></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.theflumetrail.com/"><a href="http://www.theflumetrail.com/" class="linkified">http://www.theflumetrail.com/</a></a></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a<b>Shuttle Fee: $15</b></p> <p><b>Directions:</b></p> <p>From South Lake Tahoe and the casino district, after the casino district continue north on US 50 about 12 miles to the junction of State Route 28.

V<p>This will be a day long session for photographers interested in photographing the female nude with additional post processing instruction. The time will be split into two halves- first we will work with our model under studio lights of various set-ups and available light, studying the possibilities available with each. Photographers will work individually with the model to create unique images with guidance from <i>Billy Monday</i>.</p> <p>In the second half of the workshop, we will take some of our images to the computer, studying digital processing for satisfying results in both color and black-and-white. Digital SLRs of any level are encouraged, and if you're not familiar with your camera you should remember to bring it's manual.</p> <p>Software demonstrated will include Adobe Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop, and the Google Nik Collection. At the workshop's close, you will have a handful of carefully conceived, nicely lit and creatively processed photographs, a greater working skill-set, and new friends who love this art as much as we. Billy Monday, traveling all the way from Frederick, MD, will be leading this workshop. Billy has extensive experience in capturing the beauty and complexity of the female human form. "My photographs can be placed in two general categories: those images which I make in the studio are studies in lighting, contrast and geometry; whereas the images made in the natural environment are an attempt to fuse landscape photography with figure art". All of his photographs, whether captured on film or digitally, go through a digital post-processing stage. </p> <p>For more of Billy's work, click here: <a href="http://billymonday.com" class="linkified">http://billymonday.com</a></p> <p>Bill will be traveling with <i>Mary Celeste</i>, a highly experienced figure model with an easy-going personality. Mary Celeste is an excellent subject for photographers who are studying studio work. Her classical posing style and her familiarity with the dynamic between model and photographer virtually guarantee success. </p> <p>More of Mary's work at <a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/1509848" class="linkified">http://www.modelmayhem.com/1509848</a></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a<b>Location:</b> The Lighthouse Berkeley 1310 9th St. Berkeley, CA 94710 </p> <p><b>Date and Time</b>: August 2nd, 2014 11am - 5pm<br/>Snacks and refreshments will be provided. </p> <p><b>Fee:</b> $300<br/>includes 6 hrs of educational, model fees, studio fees and a full release. Bonuses: networking, snacks, hands on training </p> <p>Things to Bring: DSLR Cameras and Lenses of your choice, Laptop loaded with Photoshop, Lightroom or comparable software, computer chargers, your creativity and energy for a full day</p> <p>About The LIGHTHOUSE Berkeley:</p> <p>The Lighthouse is a photo studio/event space in Berkeley, that runs events, workshops and meet ups for people interested in creating art. The content ranges from fashion shoots to hanging from a Lyra to fine art nudes and filling all the gaps in between. We are affiliated with amazingly talented photographers eager to share their knowledge in lighting; professional models that carefully instruct the female form in providing posing techniques for up and coming talent; and hair, make-up artists and stylists interested in making your ideas come to life. The Lighthouse is available for private bookings hourly, half days or full day rates. We have professional, internationally published models coming through monthly and also widely publicized, amazingly talented photographers on board to teach our groups on various topics. This is intended to be more of a coop of artists of various forms coming together in a common space. We are continually growing and building. You can check out the website atwww.thelighthouseberkeley.com for rates and more info. We invite you to join us!</p> <p>Want to Teach? The LIGHTHOUSE is always looking for partners that want to give back to the community and help our members grow and learn. If you have exceptional knowledge on any photography related topics, we want you! We are looking to build a community of artists seeking to enhance their skills and master their craft.</p> <p>Contact Candace at [masked] Thanks!</p>

V<p>Now open for RSVPs. Anyone may quit the walk at the half-way point, Glen Park, and leave on BART. The first half of this walk is easy, the second half is much harder because it goes up Diamond Heights. The only cost is $3 cash for the walk, but never at the starting point. Kids free. We meet in front of a Starbucks with 2 restrooms, about 1 block West of the West Portal Muni Station, cross street is Vicente. One can take the K, L, or M lines to reach the station.</p> <p>One should bring a sack lunch or buy one at our starting point. At 11:10 AM we will start walking East on Vicente Street towards St. Francis Wood which bends South and becomes Santa Clara Ave. We will continue on Santa Clara Avenue and then turn right on Monterey Boulevard. Then we visit the 2 big fountains. After exploring St. Francis Wood we will walk through Monterey Heights.</p> <p>We plan to eat our sack lunches at the Sunnyside Recreation Center and then walk to the Sunnyside Conservatory. Then we walk to Glen Park. The walk is easy up to this point, and attendees who want may leave early by the Glen Park BART Station. We will visit the newly improved Glen Park Recreation Center. Then the group walks up Diamond Heights. Then we walk down Noe Valley, and end in the Mission neighborhood. <b>I estimate the distance is 6 miles or less. Estimated arrival time at our end point, the 24th Street BART Station, is 4:15 PM.</b></p> <p>We will have plenty of restrooms stops, and will see lots of good things such as mansions, great views, parks and mini-parks. This part of SF has everything except tourists.</p> <p><b>If you have any questions about how to get around the Bay Area on public transportation below is a trip planner link:</b><br/><a href="http://transit.511.org/"><a href="http://transit.511.or" class="linkified">http://transit.511.or</a>...</a></p> <p>I discourage people from driving and parking in SF. If one has to drive to this event one can park for free during the weekends on the street in the nearby St. Francis Wood neighborhood.</p> <p><b>Some legal disclaimers:</b> By joining us for any event you hereby RELEASE and DISCHARGE it's organizers, hosts and participants from any and all liability, claims, demands or causes of action that you now have, or may have in the future, for injuries, damages, death and/or economic loss of any kind or nature, arising in whole or in part out of the activities, advice or information contained herein.

We'll have wine and cheese and baguettes and learn a little French along the way.</p> <p>It'll be $15 to draft and keep your cards. Or, you can just show up and play for free! If you decide before the draft you don't want to keep these silly French cards, there will be no charge to just come and draft and snack and hang out.</p> <p>I'm in Pleasanton, but we're not far from the Dublin/Pleasanton BART Station and will pick up anyone that needs a lift from there.</p> <p>"But Ben, I don't know French, nor do I want to learn any French!" I'm sorry, but it's too late. Thanks to the Norman conquest, English has a ton of words that come from French. You probably recognize most (if not all) of the following French words that you'll find on the M15 cards.</p> <p>\u2022 Artefact</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Aura</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Contrôle and Contrôleur</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Couleur</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Créature</p> <p>\u2022 Enchantement</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Équipement</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Exil</p> <p>\u2022 Intimidation</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Légendaire</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Mana</p> <p>\u2022 Régénérer</p> <p>That's just the beginning. Lots of other words are similar to other English words in ways that you'll recognize. You'll play Terrains to cast spells such as Rituels (Sorceries), activate Capacités (abilities), and when your creatures die, they'll enter your Cimetière. Over the next couple of weeks, I'll post a lot of other words that you might find useful, with cards to test your knowledge.</p> <p>Looking forward to playing! À bientôt !</p>

V<p>Calling San Francisco's SMALL rescue dogs for a meetup on the first Saturday of each month at 11:30 am in Pine Lake Dog Park in Stern Grove.</p> <p>If you have a small rescue dog and want to meet other rescues and their parents, please join us for off-leash play and schmoozing.</p> <p>Don't worry if your dog is quirky; ours are, too!</p> <p>RUFF co-organizer Shannon Bolt of The Domestic Animal has worked with shelter and rescue dogs for years. She specializes in special-needs animals and will be on hand for advice and assistance.</p> <p>This meetup is for <b>SMALL DOGS UP TO 25 POUNDS ONLY</b> (or who should weigh less than 25 pounds!) \u2014 the mutt-ier, the better; but we won't discriminate against purebreds \u2014 and their adult people (this is NOT the place for children; many small dogs, especially those with issues, are afraid of kids) are welcome. Please remember to give all the dogs their "space" and ask before giving treats. We'll have a great time!</p> <p>We socialize in one of the grassy areas west of the parking lot for 30\u201340 minutes (look for the RUFF sign), then we take a group walk around the park, so if you come very late, you'll have to chase us!</p>

V<p>It's baaaaack! Library Games organizer Susan went off to motherhood and then San Diego, but many have asked for this event to be revived. So bring along some games (or just a willingness to try new games) and drop in for some gamey good times. Bonus: the room is fairly sound-proof, so you can holla just as loud as you want to.</p> <p>Sadly, the library doesn't have the budget for snacks anymore, but we can bring whatever food we like, and they'll have water.</p>

V<p>Sanborn County Park in Saratoga is host to Shady Shakespeare Theatre company. This August, they'll be presenting Pride and Prejudice in the park. Let's see the play, then spend the night at the park's campgrounds.</p> <p>I have reserved 2 camping spots in the park. Each spot can hold a maximum of 2 tents and 6 people- so we'll have to double up. We'll also have to car-pool, as it's two cars per campsite (for a total of 4 tents, 4 cars and 12 people).</p> <p>THE PARK- Sanborn County Park in Santa Clara County is about an hour from San Francisco. It offers several easy hiking trails, in mostly shaded areas.<br/>THE PLAY-   According to the website, dogs are allowed at this event, but they <i>must be very well-behaved.</i>  We'll try to sit off to the side. General admission tickets to the play can be ordered here <a href="http://shadyshakes.org/tickets.php" class="linkified">http://shadyshakes.org/tickets.php</a>. Please purchase GENERAL ADMISSION  ($15)for SATURDAY AUGUST 2. It's the wonderful story of Mr Darcy and the Miss Bennetts and all so very British. <b>YOU MUST PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS BEFORE YOU SIGN UP FOR THIS EVENT.</b> Email me a copy of your receipt so I know you've purchased it. Failure to pre-purchase will move you to "not attending" status.</p> <p>THE CAMPGROUND. I have reserved walk-in camp spots # 11 and #12 for us. Near a bathroom, but with a bit of privacy. Each spot has a BBQ pit and a picnic table. DOGS MUST BE ON LEASH, and can not be left unattended in the car or tied up outside.</p> <p>MEALS- We'll figure out the logistics/menu later, but we can plan on Saturday lunch (picnic), Saturday dinner (early BBQ, plus the theatre has a concession stand with coffee, tea, wine, soft drinks, chips and candy), and Sunday breakfast. We'll stop for supplies in Saratoga and split the cost.</p> <p>We'll also figure out who is rooming with whom once we get a little closer. Tent-mates will be same gender. If you'd rather not risk having an unknown tent-mate, one option is to reserve an adjoining campsite for yourself. Choose site #13 or #14 and make a note of it in "comments" so we know to add the extra headcount.</p> <p>When you sign up, please let us know the following<br/>--Do you have a tent? the larger the better, as it will have to hold people and dogs.<br/>--What other camping/storage equipment can you bring?<br/>---We will have to car pool. Is your car large enough to take on passenger (plus dog, plus equipment). If not, please let us know that you will be a passenger and not a driver.</p> <p>This should be a fun evening, and I think we'll all be dog-tired once we get home</p>

"Sasha" Shulgin (1925-2014) at the Berkeley Community Theater. You may be familiar with Sasha's seminal books </p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PiHKAL">PiHKAL</a></p> <p> and </p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiHKAL">TiHKAL</a></p> <p>or his groundbreaking research in chemistry. But not as many knew the man himself: his sense of humor and skills as a teacher, his grace and kindness. We will share stories, savor memories, and hold space for a future that is wide open, in no small part because of the prodigious life work of Sasha and Ann Shulgin.</p> <p><br/>In the manner of many dinners and holiday parties at the Shulgin home, the reception following the service will be a potluck. All are invited to bring dishes made with love. Of course that's optional, especially if you\u2019re coming from afar.  Due to venue policy, no alcohol, other intoxicants, or smoking is allowed.</p> <p><br/>This is a free event; however, we urge you to RSVP so we can plan accordingly.

V<p>Join us for an afternoon of playing Cashflow -- and trying to get out of the Rat Race.</p> <p>Based on the principles in the #1 seller Rich Dad, Poor Dad, the game is both a lot of fun to play and a great educational tool that helps develop a stronger "investor mindset." And it's a terrific way to meet people who share similar passions about improving their financial education.</p> <p>The afternoon will start with a short presentation on Cash Flow 101 for beginners and experienced players alike.  I've learned a few tricks to playing this game that add a lot of value I'd like to share with everyone.  </p>

V<p>Startup Finance: Valuation</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/2/event_100045522.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>About:</b> Learn how to value a startup.</p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core. Valuation makes or breaks a company. It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective.

V<p>This is a moderate hike that is half in open space, half shaded.</p> <p>There is a great vista view at the top of this trail.</p> <p>The trailhead is in the lower parking lot near the public restrooms. Parking can be extremely difficult, especially on the weekends. I suggest getting there early or planning on carpooling. Be sure to bring plenty of water, snacks / sandwich, and sunscreen. This is not a dog friendly park.</p>

It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job.

V<p>Hello everyone! Id like to have our first meet up at Mountain Lake Park! It's a wonderful place to walk dogs plus there will be benches and picnic tables nearby. Use the entrance at 8th ave &amp; Lake St. Walk up the stairs and turn right. Keep walking on the path into the off leash dog area and that is where you will find me. The goal of this meet &amp; greet is to introduce ourselves to one another in order to expand our knowledge of the industry as well as our client base. Hope to see all of you there!</p>

V<p>Merhaba,</p> <p>Let's get this Turkish party started right! I'm talking wine, I'm talking cheese, and I'm talking talking Turkish -- we will also have some English practice for our Turkish friends who would like to practice that.</p> <p>The main thing is to have fun and get to know other Turkish-interested people in the Bay Area.</p> <p>WHAT: Potluck picnic of fine wines and cheese - bring some for yourself and more to share with others (other tasty snacks and beverages, of course, more than welcome to our soiree!)</p> <p>WHERE: In Gabrielson Park, a gorgeous park in Sausalito with views of the bay and city. Just hop off the SF ferry and you are right there.</p> <p>HOW: Take the 1:25 ferry from San Francisco to arrive at 1:55 right next to the park. Full schedule here:  <a href="http://www.goldengateferry.org/schedules/Sausalito.php"><a href="http://www.goldengateferry.org/schedules/Sausalito.php" class="linkified">http://www.goldengateferry.org/schedules/Sausalito.php</a></a>   - or drive, or take a bus, which runs frequently and passes through the city on the way to Sausalito. To find best route type in your address here:  <a href="http://tripplanner.transit.511.org/"><a href="http://tripplanner.transit.511.org/" class="linkified">http://tripplanner.transit.511.org/</a></a></p> <p>WHY: Because Turkish people and people who study the Turkish language are simply awesome.</p> <p>I'll arrange for the first hour to be a Turkish language practice hour - native speaker volunteers please help us! Then after it will be both languages, and an opportunity for those who want to practice there English. All levels of Turkish and English welcome.</p> <p>Görü\u015fürüz!</p> <p><br/>Rachel</p>

V<p>S'more vegan s'mores anyone?  Join us for our annual fun-filled day at Seabright/Castle Beach in Santa Cruz, complete with vegan potluck and nighttime bonfire! Michelle will arrive early in the AM in order to score a fire pit (they're limited). You can arrive anytime after 10am, but the main party will run from 2:00pm to 10:00pm.</p> <p>For those who may wonder what exactly to bring to a vegan potluck - there are many options, with the following exceptions :-) Please nothing with animal derived products including eggs, dairy, honey, cheese, and fish.  If you're unsure you can ask me and/or read labels because they even sneak dairy into things like some dark chocolates :-( and/or check out this website:  <a href="http://www.santacruzanimalrights.org/WhatsVegan"><a href="http://www.santacruzanimalrights.org/WhatsVegan" class="linkified">http://www.santacruzanimalrights.org/WhatsVegan</a></a>.  If you can, please bring your own reusable plate/silverware/cup, though we will have some back-ups.</p> <p>Some items we will need:  It will be great if someone can bring an umbrella or some type of shade structure, a folding table, some wood to burn, and vegan items for s'mores, including spikes for roasting marshmallow, i.e. wire hangers.  *Note: vegan marshmallows and chocolates are readily available, however, graham crackers without honey are not so easy.  That's where creativity and/or determination come in if anyone's so inclined.  Also, if anyone has a portable vegan barbeque pit...  You may inform others of what you plan to bring in the discussion section below.</p> <p>Feel free to bring frisbees, kites, guitars or any other beach activities you enjoy. Bring whatever you need for your own comfort: chairs, towels, sunscreen, water, and warm jackets because it can get cold.  </p> <p>Note that alcohol is prohibited on this beach.  Dogs are allowed as long as they're on leashes.</p> <p>We'll be at Seabright/Castle beach, across the street from the Museum of Natural History and just west of Seabright Avenue.  See map at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=&amp;geocode=&amp;q=santa+cruz+museum+of+natural+history&amp;sll=36.964449,-122.007616&amp;sspn=0.006498,0.01929&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;hq=santa+cruz+museum+of+natural+history&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=36.966661,-122.007616&amp;spn=0.006498,0.01929&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A"><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=&amp;geocode=&amp;q=santa+cruz+museum+of+natural+history&amp;sll=36.964449,-122.007616&amp;sspn=0.006498,0.01929&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;hq=santa+cr" class="linkified">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=&amp;geocode=&amp;q=santa+cruz+museum+of+natural+history&amp;sll=36.964449,-122.007616&amp;sspn=0.006498,0.01929&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;hq=santa+cr</a>...</a></p> <p>Please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions!</p>

V<p>This is a meeting of the Bay Area Humanists. What then is a Humanist, and what is the Philosophy of Humanism? Martin Squibbs will lead a discussion exploring these questions :-</p> <p><br/>1)  What are universal Humanistic values? Do such values exist and where do they come from?</p> <p>2)  How do we apply our values? Can our values be resolved into future goals for humanity \u2013 ie visions, missions, and objectives for Human Kind?</p> <p>-  How do we assess the current/immediate versus future costs and benefits of our actions to ourselves and others? (and to what extent should \u201cothers\u201d include other sentient beings).</p> <p>-  How do we measure and judge the emotional costs and benefits versus the material costs and benefits of our actions?</p> <p>3)  Can Science define what is right or wrong, moral or immoral, and good or bad? (ie Science informs us how to shape reality according to our wishes, but can it tell us what we should wish, and when, and why?).</p> <p>4)  Can religious people (ie people with spiritual and/or supernatural beliefs) share our values and future goals and/or be Humanists and/or can we work with them to further our common Earthy visions for humanity.</p> <p>After the discussion we will go to a nearby restaurant for dinner.</p> <p>Martin was born in the UK, living in Wales and England and gaining a Masters in Business and EE from Imperial College, London. He moved to San Jose, California, in 1994, and has spend the last 19 years living in San Jose and working for Atmel, a semi-conductor company, in engineering, marketing and business development roles. Since the late 90\u2019s he has been involved with the Humanist Community in Silicon Valley, currently holding the position of Vice President of the Board, and aside from Humanism, is interested in Neuroscience and the Mind, our environment, macro-economics and social justice.</p> <p>If you want to find out more about the Bay Area Humanists check out our <a href="http://www.sfhumanists.org">website</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bayareahumanists">Facebook</a> page.  If you have questions, <a href="mailto:[masked]">e-mail</a> us. </p>

V<p>Cooperidge -- great food but, as a friend of mine told me today (hence the Meet Up), "one of the best bars I've been to in the Bay Area, period". Whoa. I was "meaning" to go for the last few months and now this is going on calendar. Hope to see you there!</p>

V<p>The meeting starts at 3 p.m. and lasts until 6. Stay as long, or as little, as you like. Come in and show off your latest project - finished or not - and admire the projects of others. Knitters and crocheters - we've even had tatters - are all welcome. We have experts as well as beginners - come for help if you need it, help others if you can. These meetings definitely have the potential for good karma...<br/>Hope to see you there!</p>

Save the date for our first Saturday afternoon gathering in San Francisco at the venerable BAVC headquarters in the Mission. We expect a lively crowd for a presentation or two, networking and more.</p> <p>More details to come soon!</p>

V<p>Let's get this group off the ground and get to know eachother, and let's not do it at a crowded downtown bar with crappy parking and dark lighting this time. (Sorry, previous "first meet-up" attendees--we're working on it.)</p> <p>The Aqui in South San Jose has a better seating area for groups, so we'll meet there, mid-day when it won't be too crowded. An RSVP would be extremely helpful so that we can get a table set up before people arrive.</p> <p>For those of you who have not had Aqui, they serve fresh, local-ish "Cal Mex" food and signature "Industrial Strength" alcoholic beverages. Signature drinks are around $7-9 each and food is around $10-20 a plate.</p> <p>Looking forward to hopefully meeting a good group of new people there!</p>

V<p>Come join us as we kick off our HOT AUGUST NIGHTS KARAOKE with a special fundraiser to support our Member KJ Vera whose son Angelo Buzz was killed tragically in a motorcycle accident with semi truck in June.  The fundraiser is to help KJ Vera and Angelo's surviving children with funeral and other expenses.</p> <p>La Playa Bonita (formerly the Creekside) has offered to host the fundraiser.  KJ Vera is organizing it with them and more details will be provided later as we get additional information.  Here is what we know so far:</p> <p>* There will be a $10.00 cover charge at the door of which we understand 100% will be going to KJ Vera directly.</p> <p>* This event will run from 4:00pm - 1:00am. This is an adult function with a KJ for karaoke, a DJ for Angelo's favorite music and a live band for your dancing pleasure.</p> <p>* There will be a HUGE raffle, t-shirt &amp; cd sales throughout the night.</p> <p>*  Karaoke will be held from 4 pm to 7 p.m. with a KJ/DJ tba.   After 7:00 p.m. there will be live music and dancing. For now, I am scheduling this meetup to start at 4:00 p.m.  I will update as I get new info.</p> <p>Please come support our Member KJ Vera Contreras and her family during this difficult time.   </p> <p>Hope you can make it.</p>

V<p>THIS EVENT IS FOR <a href="http://www.meetup.com/aroundthecraftingtable/pages/Crafting_Queen/">CRAFTING QUEENS</a> ONLY. It is a home event.</p> <p>"The best portion of a good man's life is his little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and of love." - William Wordsworth</p> <p>Use your creativity to support deployed military women and men by crafting Holiday (Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, generic holiday) greeting cards they can share with their loved ones at home through <a href="http://operationwritehome.org">Operation Write Home</a>. </p> <p>Please bring your own supplies. We'll use the beginning portion (or all) of our time crafting the cards. Whatever remaining time left, you're welcome to work on your own projects. </p> <p>You are welcome to bring completed cards with you or create them while we're together. </p> <p><b>Familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://operationwritehome.org/guidelines/">Operation Write Home Guidelines</a>.</b></p> <p>1. NO GLITTER! Really!</p> <p>2. A2 sized cards only, 4.25\u2033 x 5.5\u2033. Envelopes will be available at the event.</p> <p>3. Line the inside of your cards if your cards are made with dark card stock. If pencil isn't easily visible, then line the inside. I usually use copy paper.</p> <p>4. Because we're crafting these cards at least 4 weeks before the holiday deadline, we are welcome to make multiples of the same card design.</p> <p>5. Use quality supplies. Make sure your cards can withstand the rigors of shipping overseas and back again. <i>Please remember that the card you make could be a family\u2019s last contact with their hero. </i>Use good cardstock and adhesive, make sure it will stay together, and produce your best work!</p> <p>Be cautious of embellishments that might fall off. Avoid "post card" style cards or fancy-fold cards with nowhere to write. No flimsy card bases (copier paper or lightweight patterned paper). </p> <p>6. <i>Some</i> dimension is ok, but don't go wild.</p> <p>7. Card themes.<br/>Remember who\u2019s sending these cards: adults. Please do not send cards with sentiments \u201cto\u201d Daddy or Mommy, no \u201cwish you were here,\u201d or party invitations; and no explicit images or sentiments out of respect for cultures and sensitivities. Halloween cards should be cheerful ones, not scary \u2013 lest a card with a skull end up as the final communication by a fallen hero. The best cards for our heroes\u2019 use are actually designs that can be sent at any time of year \u2013 they can customize them for any occasion by writing their note inside. NO get well, sympathy, anniversary, or other specific themes are needed, please! <a href="http://operationwritehome.org/deadlines/">See a list of themes here.</a></p> <p>No inappropriate themes (new baby announcement, party invite, cards for daddy or mommy, welcome to the neighborhood, etc).</p> <p>8. Absolutely NO storebought cards.</p> <p>9. For our event, no photo cards.</p> <p>10. NO handwritten sentiments.</p> <p>Christmas stamps will be avaible at the table. But, you are welcome to bring your own.</p> <p>OWH has a special stamp for us to use on the back of the cards. This stamp will be at the table. We will all be sure to stamp our own cards before turning them in. Sam will collect the cards when you're done.</p> <p><b>Just for fun...</b> Come dressed in some holiday cheer (whatever that means to you).</p> <p><b>Food &amp; Drinks</b></p> <p>We will order out for dinner. Please bring cash (small denominations) to pitch in for food. If you have a craving, suggest it in the comment section.</p> <p>Water, Coffee, Tea will be provided. If you have any specific drink you prefer, please bring.</p> <p>Dessert will be provided.</p> <p><b>Reminders:</b></p> <p>ACT Membership dues, if not payed yet, is $10 (Paid to Juliana. 1 time a year). Cash only. Exact value appreciated.</p> <p>Please keep your RSVP updated. *If there are no more spots, please join the wait list. As space opens up, you'll be moved into a YES spot. Return tothe event page often to double check your RSVP as I do not believe Meetup sends automated notifications. (If you are moved into a YES spot but didn't realize and don't show up, it will count against you as it's holding a spot someone else could have.)</p>

We\u2019ll zip through the ghettos, pass the mansions and view the scenery very few people get to see in a week let alone in a single evening.</p> <p><img src="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/7721728740974823239/img/smileys/tongue.gif" /></p> <p>This ride is generally within posted speed limits, but the route is highly technical, scary, spooky, challenging and -- at the same time \u2013 exhilarating, breathtaking and absolutely positively fun.</p> <p>We'll make a few rest and coffee breaks, but not long enough for a big meal, just what you can find at Starbucks ;~)</p> <p>|||   Space is limited - RSVP ASAP - Not for newbies or for the faint of heart  |||</p> <p>\u2022 For meal, arrive by 4:30 PM  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/GroupRides/pages/Location_SF_%28SPB%29">&lt;click - for your eyes only&gt;</a>  Bring ID to get in.</p> <p>\u2022 For ride only, arrive by 5:30 PM, KSU 5:45 PM</p> <p>(ride ends around midnight, or whenever we get sleepy.  There are breakaway points for those who need to get home early to relief the babysitter). </p> <p>/&lt;a&gt;\u005c/\u005c/\u005c/\u005c&lt;/a&gt; No official pre-ride this time.  Let's just meet in SF.  Remember to fill up or have enough gas for 60 miles &lt;a&gt;\u005c/\u005c/\u005c/\u005c&lt;/a&gt;/</p> <p><a href="http://www.groupridesforum.net/events/67616862/">&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>Our Last Rides: </p> <p><a href="http://youtu.be/IGYMlhW50M0" class="embedded">http://youtu.be/IGYMlhW50M0</a></p> <p>  </p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/3/4/600_165219732.jpeg" /></p> <p>\u2022 Tentative Stops:</p> <p>If you get separated from the group, don\u2019t worry.

To keep the size of the group manageable, we\u2019ll limit the number of bikes.  MeetUp system doesn\u2019t distinguish between # of bikes and # of people.  Therefore, if you have a passenger simply indicate it in the comment section, and show only count of \u201c1\u201d in your RSVP for your bike.  If you wish to invite a riding buddy with own bike, please have them join and RSVP.</p> <p><img src="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/48961800108910343402/img/smileys/laughing.gif" /></p> <p>Dinner &amp; Ride or Just Ride? In your RSVP, please state if you are joining us for dinner as well, or only the ride.  This way I know how many seats we'll need.</p> <p><img src="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/1723755200050492932723/img/smileys/biggrin.gif" /></p> <p>\u2022 Pace:  Not too slow.  Not too fast.  Just right.</p> <p>\u2022 Gear: Head to toe.  It may be cold in May, so wear layers.</p> <p>\u2022 Motorcycle: Yes, please bring one with you ;-)</p> <p><br/>~ Please review Liability Release statement at <a href="http://www.groupridesforum.net/pages/Liability_Release/">THIS LINK</a></p> <p>~ Proper gear, a working machine and gas in the tank is highly recommended.<br/>~ Ride within your comfort zone and leave room for bad karma.<br/>~ I may pass slower traffic when it's safe. You don't have to. Remember, someone will wait for you at turns, so just relax and have fun.<br/>~ I maintain the Pace according to road conditions with safety of all riders in mind. Be mindful of others in the group. Let faster riders get ahead of you by moving to the right and signaling them to pass you. And if you want to pass the rider(s) who are in front of you, make sure to do so safely and without startling them.<br/>~ If you know the area and would like to sweep for the group please let me know.<br/>~ Good stuff to read before going on group rides (<a href="http://www.groupridesforum.net/messages/boards/thread/9266605">CLICK</a>).<br/>~ Keep an eye for the rider(s) behind you so they won't take a wrong turn. If they get lost, you'll buy their dinner<br/>~ City riding means traffic lights, stop signs and of course other vehicles.  Below is an exaggerated case, but it illustrates that getting separated doesn't mean getting lost. BLUE dots are riders going from A to G points of a route. RED dots are the riders who have stopped and are waiting for the rider behind them.  When stopping at a turn for a rider who is behind you, wait "before" the turn so they see you.  Not "after" or "in" the turn, because by the time they realize you have turned, they have missed the turn, or they may not even see you at all.  If you approach a rider who is waiting for you, but you don't see the rider behind you, please stop at the same stop so the one waiting can go while you wait for the rest to arrive. REMEMBER, WE ALL WAIT .... ALL EXCEPT THE SWEEP SINCE HE IS THE LAST ONE</p> <p><img src="http://img1.meetupstatic.com/816470374029094449829953/img/smileys/devilish.gif" /></p> <p><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y73/Motopars/SF3.jpg" /></p> <p>Frequent Pauses:</p> <p>As you can see, we'll have a large size group (20+ bikes). So, just like a Caterpillar, the \u201cHead\u201c section will have to wait for the \u201cTail\u201d to arrive. Therefore, there will be frequent \u201cpauses\u201d to make sure the chain is not broken and that we have riders who are \u201cmarking\u201d the turns for people behind them. We need a few volunteers \u2026. 1 for sweep, of course. Plus 2 more \u201cadvanced\u201d riders who will help with a smooth flow. Please email me if you feel comfortable helping out. .</p> <p><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y73/Motopars/catapilar.jpg" /></p> <p>Tight Group:</p> <p>We need to zip thru traffic lights and stop signs in as many at a time as possible.  Ride staggered, and if we do come to a stop, feel free to fill all lanes that we can take so as soon as light turns green a whole bunch of us can pass before it turns red again.  Picture below shows how to keep a tight group(distance from riders ahead of you) but only on straights and flat sections with good view.   When on crooked streets, uphills or down hills, ride single file 2-3 seconds apart.  Remember, 2-3 seconds means the distance from rider in front or behind you will vary according to the speed at the time.  Please don't tailgate or crowd the rider in front of you.  But if you see you are getting far from the rider in front, and the bikes behind you are on your tail, it means you'll be more comfortable riding closer to the tail end of the group which is normally slower.  When it's safe, move to the right and signal them to pass you.  And if you want to pass a slower rider, make sure to do so safely.</p> <p>If you feel uncomfortable for any reason make sure to chat with Mehran or the sweep at the next stop so we can figure out how best to assist the situation.</p> <p><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y73/Motopars/staggered.jpg" /></p> <p>Down Hills:</p> <p>SF Hills (going down) can be intimidating.  Downshift (2nd gear, or even 1st if you like) and lean back a little.  Cover front brakes.  If you are comfortable with "trail braking", cover the rear brake also, but DON'T lock the rear wheel.  Just a gentle tap on the pedal.  Prepare for sudden stops by the rider ahead of you.  LEAVE 2-3 seconds distance.</p> <p>Going up hills is the same principal.  Shift weight forward and lean on the tank.</p> <p><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y73/Motopars/DownHill.jpghttp://img2.meetupstatic.com/7721728740974823239/img/smileys/tongue.gif" /></p> <p>.. and of course the cardinal rule of watching out for the riders behind you.  Everyone must keep an eye for the rider behind them.  The only one who is exempt is the sweep, and that's because he is the last rider</p> <p><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y73/Motopars/Thread%20Pics/waitatturns-1.gif" /></p> <p><img src="http://media.abclocal.go.com/three/kgo/weather/WSI/kgotv_7day.jpg" /></p> <p>Check out <a href="http://www.meetup.com/GroupRides/messages/boards/thread/44617702">GRF Boutique</a> !!</p> <p><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y73/Motopars/CapHatGif_zpsdd7bba2b.gif" /></p>

V<p>For a change of pace, let's get decked out and go to a nice place to listen to some graceful piano and guitar Jazz duo while sipping cocktails.</p> <p>The Bay Area's most renown young Jazz pianist Adam Shulman (not the actor who married Hathaway), and the SCU and CSMA (Mt. View) Jazz faculty guitarist Jim Witzel will serenade our scrumptious dinner at the upscale lounge of a very popular Brazilian restaurant, Pampas, Palo Alto. Why have dinner in the lounge? Because the food is 1/2 the price.<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25jBs3ueRgY" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25jBs3ueRgY</a><br/>Also see Adam Shulman's website for more info on his music: <a href="http://www.adamshulman.com/music.html" class="linkified">http://www.adamshulman.com/music.html</a></p> <p>We'll meet there at 6 PM and start our lounge dinner. Miki will be wearing a badge. It may not be possible for the group to be seated together if the group is larger than 6, but we'll at least be sitting close by.</p> <p>For more info and the lounge menu, visit Pampas' site at: <a href="http://www.pampaspaloalto.com/" class="linkified">http://www.pampaspaloalto.com/</a></p>

V<p>Once again the San Jose Symphony offers its free Summer Pops concerts on the lawn at San Jose State University. These are terrific events to picnic, socialize and listen to great music!</p> <p>Tonight will be the stars of Classical Mystery Tour, alums of Broadway's "Beatlemania," return for an evening of the Beatles' greatest hits, backed by Symphony Silicon Valley. Symphony Silicon Valley's free, outdoor, music festival features delightful, fully-produced, lawn concerts on the iconic Tower Lawn at San Jose State University.</p> <p>SJSU has plastic chairs if you want to sit on those or you can bring your own or sit on the grass. You will want to get there a bit early to get the best space.</p> <p><b>Group Meeting at 5:30 pm.</b> People do come to these events fairly early to get the best possible seats and so do I. There are two entrances at the MLK library, the street side and the Tower Lawn side. I will meet people at the Tower Lawn side, which is behind the MLK library across from the Tower Lawn. No offense to any of you but I will only wait 10-15 minutes for folks and then I will head over to the seating area. I've had way too many people in the past say they would show and don't.</p> <p><b>PICNIC:</b> 6:00 Bring food/snacks to share, wine, etc....</p> <p><b>PERFORMANCE:</b> Begins at 7:00</p> <p><b>Parking: </b></p> <p><b>City of San Jose 4th Street Garage</b> <a href="http://sjdowntownparking.com/parking-map/lots-and-garages-list"><a href="http://sjdowntownparking.com/parking-map/lots-and-garages-list" class="linkified">http://sjdowntownparking.com/parking-map/lots-and-garages-list</a></a> </p> <p><b>SJSU 4th &amp; 7th Garages</b> are close to the event <a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/parking/maps/garages/"><a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/parking/maps/garages/" class="linkified">http://www.sjsu.edu/parking/maps/garages/</a></a></p> <p><b>NOTE: </b> There is a Safeway on 100 S. Second Street for snacks or food to pick up for the Picnic.</p> <p><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-market-by-safeway-san-jose"><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-market-by-safeway-san-jose" class="linkified">http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-market-by-safeway-san-jose</a></a></p>

Without the work of mentally quieting the mind, kirtan can carry us effortlessly to a place of quiet, to stillness. One of the oldest sacred music traditions of the world, the kirtan call-and-response chanting genre comes to us from India. Using ancient Sanskrit mantras, the kirtan calls upon sacred energies which serve to quiet the mind, remove obstacles to meditation. Singing traditional Sanskrit mantras has a profound effect on the environment and consciousness, helping to elevate the mind, heal the body, and open the heart. No experience is necessary.</p> <p> </p> <p>"Satsang is the shelter from the changing time and its harsh influence on life" <br/>Sri Sri Ravi Shankar</p> <p> </p> <p>This event is sponsored by the Art of Living Foundation</p> <p> </p>

V<p><b>An Ecstatic Dance journey through the elements of<br/></b> <b>Air, Fire, Water, Earth and back to our Center.</b></p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/4/6/6/600_97966182.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>Every 1st and 3rd Saturdays of the month</b>, from 8pm - 11pm, in Los Gatos.</p> <p>Dance Elemental offers a unique expression of ecstatic dance culture, inspired by nature-centered traditions. Music is selected to take you on a journey through the four elements that leads you back to your center (Spirit). This sacred container is created for authentic self expression through dance, meditation in motion, deep play, spiritual centering and community.  Allow your True Self to be revealed! </p> <p>\u000a\u000a<b>When? </b> <br/>Monthly on 1st and 3rd Saturdays<br/>8pm - 11pm <br/>(Registration opens at 7:30)</p> <p><b>Where?</b> <br/>Los Gatos Acupuncture and Qigong Center <br/>761 University Ave - Suite A <br/>Los Gatos, CA 95032</p> <p><b>Suggested Donations:</b></p> <p><br/>$15 - Individual Adult admit at the door.<br/>$5  - Teens 16 - 19<br/>(Children 15-and-under come FREE.)<br/>*Minors must be accompanied by an Adult*</p> <p><br/><a href="http://devagnosis.eventbrite.com/">Pre-register online and save a buck. </a> <br/>Sign up now for $14</p> <p>Or <a href="http://devagnosis.eventbrite.com/">sign up early with a friend and get a sweet deal!</a> <br/>Check out our Dance Duo! Two admitted for $25 (when purchased in advance). </p> <p><a href="http://devagnosis.eventbrite.com/"><a href="http://devagnosis.eventbrite.com/" class="linkified">http://devagnosis.eventbrite.com/</a></a></p> <p><br/>++Volunteer/Trade opportunities available.  Contact the organizers in advance.</p> <p>\u000a\u000a<b>Need More info? Cool... keep reading. </b> </p> <p>Basic structure: A large and beautiful sacred space for free-form dancing to amazing music in a loving community environment. </p> <p>* Be moved by Live DJ with Live Drumming and Improvisational music too! </p> <p>* Bring your heart-felt intention and dance it into being. You are welcome to bring a token to represent your intention if you so desire, and place it on the Community Altar as we journey together.</p> <p>* Areas are set up for meditation, energy/body work, and community networking. Healthy snacks, tea and water are provided. We invite volunteer Reiki healers and other energy/body workers to attend the healing areas.</p> <p>* Yoga Mats / Back Jacks / Chairs available. Feel free to bring your own yoga mats for stretching or lying down.</p> <p>* All ages welcome! Young children should be supervised by parents/guardians.</p> <p>* New-comers welcome and encouraged!<br/>If this is your first Dance with us, we strongly encourage you to arrive by no later than 8:00 p.m. sharp for a helpful and brief orientation.  This really helps to get everyone clear about how we can participate fully and have the best time possible at our dance.</p> <p><br/><b>* Important Guidelines and Tips * </b></p> <p>1. We kindly ask for a Talk-Free dance floor.<br/>This allows for people to go deeper into their Dance and connect with their journey through the Elements. (Chat and conversation is welcome in the tea room, outside, or very quietly just off the dance floor in the "Chill out zone".) </p> <p>2. Dance however you want. There is no right or wrong way. Listen to your body and move to the way it feels. Express who you are from the inside out. </p> <p>3. Respect yourself as well as those around you. Pay attention to your boundaries and the boundaries of others. Communicate through eye contact and body language. Be compassionate and aware. If it becomes necessary to use your words, please feel free to do so in a respectful way.<br/>Many participants find meaningful interactions on the dance floor which both surprise and delight.</p> <p>4. Bring extra water - Mainly recommended for those who get very thirsty while exercising, or have a cold. </p> <p>5. Wear clothes that make you feel good and are comfortable for dancing. Be expressive and colorful if you like, or just show up in your sweats. It's all good! Dancing barefoot or in socks is fine. Shoes are ok, but heavy tread shoes or heals are not allowed. Most dance shoes or slippers are great. </p> <p>6. We are a clean and sober venue.  No drugs or alcohol, period.</p> <p>7. Please, do not bring cameras to the event.  Personal photo/video without express permission (from subjects and the organizers alike) is not allowed.<br/>This guideline is for everyone's assurance of privacy and feeling of safety.</p> <p>8. ALL ages and genders are welcome. </p> <p>9. Be yourself! </p> <p><br/><b>* Even MORE about the Dance * </b> <br/>~ IF YOU HAVE NEVER ATTENDED BEFORE... Please take a few minutes to read the rest. ~</p> <p>We welcome all to the Dance.  Open your heart, and dissolve any blocks of judgment and fear.  Come, move your body and soul to a handpicked mix of music: inspirational, uplifting, world beat, tribal, funk, pop, electronica, trance, ambient and much more.  Live improvisational music and inspired guided meditations set to music are often part of the evening to transition us from element to element, focusing intention as we journey together through the experience.</p> <p>As we dance, we can reintegrate and refuel ourselves through communion with the Elements of Air, Fire, Water, and Earth, naturally leading us back to the center of our being.  Each Element can be treated as an initiation into a spiritual journey, each one having a unique resonance within us. This practice is designed to propel us towards greater integration between our bodies and higher consciousness, as well as our community.<br/>As a community, we recognize that we can learn and grow by witnessing and supporting one another through our shared expressions of each elemental energy.  Let's work those edges together, and return ourselves to a life of deep trusting.<br/>Rediscover and liberate your heart of hearts together through dance!</p> <p><br/><b>* What to expect when you arrive * </b></p> <p>Arrive to soft music. Check in first, and then quietly find a place for your things. You may choose to be welcomed with a cleansing/smudge (smoke-free mist). Relax, breathe and stretch as others arrive. </p> <p>We will be called together for a welcoming circle, speaking of our names, brief orientation, and grounding meditation. Then the dancing starts. </p> <p>There are several "stations" throughout the venue to help you with being present during the Dance. </p> <p>1. Drumming: <br/>There are an assortment of drums/shakers available for you to play. You may borrow available instruments or bring your own. (Remember to remove rings/bracelets.) Please attend children. The goal is to support the dancers by adding to the energy of the music. Sensitivity and awareness is key to holding the energy in the room...<br/>If you are new to drumming, please ask for guidance.  We are happy to provide this as a growth opportunity and chance to try this form of expression in alignment with the Dance.  [DevaGnosis also holds monthly Drum Circles for further exploration.]</p> <p>2. "Tea" Room: <br/>Need a refresher? We have a lovely table with healthy snacks to help re-energize and 'ground' you.  A great place to chat as well. </p> <p>3. Chill out zone: <br/>Need to be still for awhile? This is a cozy space set aside for meditation/stillness. </p> <p>4. Healing: <br/>Feeling tapped? Reiki Practitioners and experienced Energy and Body Workers from within our community are often available to offer their care to re-energize and align the participants.  LGAQ has a few private offices set up for our use during the evening.<br/>If you are a practitioner willing to offer service, please contact an organizer for further details.  (What a great way to highlight your personal practice.)</p> <p>5. Community Altar: <br/>This is a space for you to focus your energy and intention or to draw inspiration from during the dance. You may bring something to place on or near the altar if you feel called to do so. </p> <p>6. Community networking area: <br/>This surface is set up near the entrance so that we can get to know one another better. Bring your business cards and brochures, event flyers, freebies, etc. <br/>Please take a moment to look through the materials during the evening and collect anything of interest. Seek and ye shall find. </p> <p><br/><b>* Closing Process* </b></p> <p>At the end of the night, we usually end with a simple Heart Sharing with a few words spoken by those who wish to speak about what they experienced and any gratitudes, etc. There is also time allowed for community announcements before we part.</p> <p>Remember, you are free to bring flyers for your events/services and put them on the community networking table as well. </p> <p><br/><a href="http://devagnosis.eventbrite.com/"><a href="http://devagnosis.eventbrite.com/" class="linkified">http://devagnosis.eventbrite.com/</a></a></p> <p>\u000a\u000a"Dance Elemental" TM - DevaGnosis 2008</p> <p>************<br/>Dakini's cell: [masked]<br/>Tymn's cell: [masked]</p>

V<p>The Tour de Peninsula is coming up again. August 4th at Coyote Point. Those that have done this ride will know it offers great value for the $45 entry fee ($50 after July 1). A lot of families participate together, some people don't wear lycra and there are almost none of the weekend racer types.</p> <p><a href="http://supportparks.org/tdp/event.html" class="linkified">http://supportparks.org/tdp/event.html</a></p> <p><br/>Route options include 20 miles, 31 miles, 56 and 63 miles. All routes include the great Sawyer Camp Trail alongside Crystal Springs Reservoir. The start/finish venue is Coyote Point Park, which is a warm, sunny, bayside location shaded by big eucalyptus trees.</p> <p>Meetup members usually ride at their own pace and then meet for a post-ride lunch and story-sharing at a picnic table in the finish area. Rides begin at 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. depending on the route option.</p>

The start is too early for BART or CalTrain, so people will have to either ride or carpool. I will ride.  If you can offer space in your car, post a comment below. If the passengers want a ride back with you, be sure to coordinate on ride distance.</p>

V<p>Join us for a half day climb up Mt. Tamalpais in support of At The Crossroads (ATC), a local non-profit that empowers homeless youth. The full hike is about 8 miles, and will probably take 4 to 5 hours round trip. If you haven't been to Mt. Tam, it's a mellow hike with gorgeous views. It's definitely one of those refreshing places that make you fall in love with life again. Since the hike is a fundraiser for ATC, they request that you register for $20 here (<a href="http://atthecrossroads.org/summersunday/index.php" class="linkified">http://atthecrossroads.org/summersunday/index.php</a>). You can also fundraise if you'd like but that's entirely up to you. ATC is offering van pools so we can hitch a ride from their office. Vans leave at 7:45am so please don't be late or you'll seriously be left behind :)</p> <p>Post up with questions, cheers to working out for a cause!</p>

V<p>If anyone is interested in doing a photowalk on street art, Flickr is hosting a worldwide photowalk event on August 3rd. Let's go out and shoot around the Mission District's famous street art! We had fun the last time around and I know there are members out there who would love to check out the colorful alleys!</p> <p>Exercise your street photography skills. Capture textures, details and develop your "eye". While shooting solo has it's rewards, a small group walking close together provides safety in numbers, particularly in some parts of the urban landscape. </p> <p>We will meet at a predetermined location that I will send to those on the final RSVP list. I will be at the location before 7:30 AM. We will do a quick meet and greet, go over some basics then start our hike. Be ready for an easy walk of about 2 miles on flat grade. This will be done during the early morning to make the most of the light, avoid the heat and we will be winding our way along some alleyways to capture street art. At the end of the walk, we can stop for coffee and pastries.</p> <p>Things to bring(recommended):</p> <p>Camera, one lens (fixed or zoom)</p> <p>Memory cards</p> <p>extra battery</p> <p>Pack light and bring some water for hydration</p> <p>Walking shoes and comfortable clothing</p> <p>No tripods are needed so you can leave them home.</p> <p>I will be sending out an email to those attending a few days before the actual event with the final location.</p>

V<p>I have a free Sunday the first weekend in August so am offering another weekend Gear Knots and Anchors class. If there is more interest in my Trad Follower class I would be willing to teach that class instead.</p> <p>Please make sure to read all details below. Location of class will be texted to the group once everyone has had a chance to RSVP. \u2022 Do you want to climb more often, but don\u2019t know how to build safe climbing anchors yourself?<br/>\u2022 Are you interested in joining a climbing group outing, but don\u2019t know who knows how to build safe climbing anchors and who doesn\u2019t?<br/>\u2022 Have you ever risked climbing on somebody else\u2019s anchors without knowing whether they are safe or not first?<br/>\u2022 Are you lacking the knowledge needed to assess a climbing anchor before trusting it with your life?<br/>\u2022 Do you want to gain the knowledge and skills to build safe climbing anchors yourself?</p> <p>If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then this could be the class for you.</p> <p>Note: no climbing class will give you the instant ability to build safe climbing anchors. This requires time, careful study, practice and hands on experience preferably under the watchful eye of an experienced and competent anchor builder. This class will not make you an expert anchor builder overnight, but it will teach you the basic skills and knowledge necessary to be able to assess other people\u2019s climbing anchors and give you the skills you need to start becoming proficient in building your own anchors.</p> <p>Confirmation for class: please send me your cell # through my profile in case something happens last minute or you have trouble finding us the day of the class. I will text you confirmation once I receive your email. My text is your confirmation you are rsvp'd for the class and I will update your confirmation accordingly</p> <p>Climbing Gear, Knots and Anchors class</p> <p>Class is taught by an AMGA trained instructor with 10+ years of experience teaching technical skills and systems used for rock climbing.</p> <p>Learn how to assess a climbing anchor before you climb on it and how to build safe climbing anchors yourself</p> <p>1) Gear</p> <p>a) typical gear used in climbing anchors</p> <p>i) Hard gear i) Bolts and bolt hangers ii) Locking carabiners iii) Non-locking carabiners</p> <p>ii) Soft gear i) Cordelette ii) Sewn slings iii) Webbing iv) Static cord</p> <p>b) Proper handling of gear. Learn how to handle gear properly so you never drop anything. This can get costly $$$.</p> <p>2) Knots \u2013 primary knots used in climbing anchors and simple ways to learn them and dress them properly a) Overhand knot (for learning purposes only, not to be used in climbing) b) Double overhand knot \u2013 easy way to tie it c) Triple overhand knot d) Overhand on a bight e) Fisherman\u2019s knot (for learning purposes only, not to be used in climbing) f) Double fisherman's knot g) Triple fisherman\u2019s knot h) Figure eight on a bight i) Water knot (the better way)</p> <p>3) Other frequently used knots: a) Figure eight follow through (the better way) with Yosemite finish b) Clove hitch (how to tie one-handed) c) Girth hitch d) Autoblock hitch e) Prusik hitch</p> <p>4) Difference between a hitch and a knot</p> <p>5) Physics, vectors and angular forces</p> <p>6) SERENE anchors (some may be familiar with acronyms SRENE and EARNEST)</p> <p>7) Basic anchor scenarios (bolted anchors) a) Two piece anchors at same height b) Two piece anchors at different height c) Three piece anchors</p> <p>8) Advanced anchor scenarios (as time permits) a) \u201cTrad\u201d anchors using passive and active protection (nuts, hexes, cams)</p> <p>9) Natural anchors (as time permits) a) Trees b) Blocks c) Horns d) Pinch offs e) Chockstones f) Slots</p> <p>Recommended personal gear:</p> <p>No personal gear is required, but if you have gear that you would like to bring and learn how to use then feel free to bring it. Please check your gear with Stan before the start of the class. If you don't have gear yet, but want to get some then this class will help you figure out what gear you need to practice and build your own anchors.</p> <p><br/>A harness is highly recommended. A notepad for writing down notes is a good idea. There will be a lot of information to learn so notes will be a good idea for when you practice your knots and anchors at home.</p> <p>A folding lawn chair is welcome during the lecture portion of the class.</p> <p>All other gear will be provided.</p> <p>Classes are usually taught in a park in Alameda. Other locations can be negotiated by request for groups.</p> <p><br/>Class size: minimum 4, maximum 8 (more possible by request and at instructor's discretion)</p> <p>Time for class: this is an all-day class that usually runs 6+ hours depending on the overall learning ability of the group. Because this is a fairly long class you should bring some water and food to snack on.</p> <p>Cost: $40</p> <p>Rain cancels class.</p> <p>Confirmation for class: please send me your cell # and email address through my profile in case something happens and I need to contact you or vice versa . I will text you confirmation once I receive your email. My text is your confirmation you are rsvp'd for the class and I will update your confirmation accordingly</p> <p>Note: prior students who have already taken my class in the past are welcome to take it again at no charge. If the class is full new students have priority, but should not be a problem accommodating you if notified in advance.</p>

V<p>Weekend Itsy Bitsy Yoga Class: This will be a mixed age yoga class and we shall offer it the first (Non Holiday) Sunday of each month.</p> <p>Calling all newborns to crawlers, Itsy Bitsy Yoga has been shown to help with a baby\u2019s circulation, sleep, muscle &amp; brain development and is a great bonding time! Drop in Class: $10.00; 3 class package for $25.00; OHM members get an additional FREE Class!</p> <p>WHAT: Baby Itsy Bitsy Yoga classes contain dozens of unique yoga postures designed to support baby\u2019s development. Each class is filled with calming, nurturing ways to enhance bonding and improve baby\u2019s sleep.</p> <p>During a Baby Itsy Bitsy Yoga class, babies enjoy yoga while on their backs, tummies, or held in loving arms. For parents, this class is a special opportunity to meet other moms, get support, and learn about baby's emerging personality. Most of the yoga we do in Itsy Bitsy Yoga is for baby, but you will also learn breathing and relaxation techniques as you practice a bit of yoga yourself. No yoga is experience required</p> <p>FIRST SUNDAY of each month at 9:30 am-10:15 am in the Sports Basement LOFT</p>

V<p>I have been looking for a place where we could all gather and meet each other but have not had any luck, so I think we will just need to meet at my house. It's not real big but in the summer we can meet outside on the patio. Let's say from 9:30am to 12:30pm. Everyone will need to bring a dish to share and I will provide the beverages, a dessert, and the place! I would greatly enjoy hearing what interests you have regarding herbs and hope you can share some ideas about what you would like to see this Meetup group doing.</p>

V<p>El primer domingo de cada mes a las 10 am nos reunimos en el Tennessee Valley Trailhead de Mill Valley. Es un paseo tranquilo de 3,4 millas de ida y vuelta a la playa. Regresamos al mediodía. Si quieres, trae un bocadillo o algún vino para compartir en la playa. Si el clima no estuviera bien, les enviaré el día anterior el nombre de un restaurante en que podremos reunirnos. ¡Hasta pronto!</p> <p>Todos los niveles son bienvenidos. Si no conoces este lugar, las direcciones en google está bien -- pero toma en cuenta que necesitas conducir . . . seguir y seguir conduciendo y finalmente vas a llegar al termino de la calle y al principio del sendero. No para cuando encuentres el aviso que dice Tennessee Valley sino que continúa al termino de la calle. Habrá un aviso de cartón, hecho a mano, encima de una de las mesas que dice Caminamos y Hablamos en Español.</p> <p>Si llegaras tarde, podrías encontrarnos en la playa. El sendero correcto es el sendero que parece la continuación de la calle.</p> <p><b>Lo siento pero se prohiben los perros.</b></p> <p>The first Sunday of every month at 10 am we meet at the Tennessee Valley Trailhead in Mill Valley. It\u2019s a 3.4 mile relaxing stroll out to the beach and back. You will be back by noon. Bring a snack or wine to share on the beach, if you like. If the weather is not good I will send a note the day before with the name of a local cafe where we can meet.</p> <p>All levels welcome. If you are unfamiliar with the trailhead, google directions work well -- but know that you just keep driving and driving and driving and then finally you will find the end of the road and the beginning of the trail. Be sure to go all the way to the end of the road, not stop at the sign that says Tennessee Valley. There will be a handmade cardboard sign on top of the table that says Caminamos y Hablamos en Español.</p> <p>If you arrive late, you can find us on the beach. The correct trail is the one that is the continuation of the road.</p> <p><b>Sorry, but dogs are not allowed.</b></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

V<p><b>Shooting Victoria: Madness, Mayhem and the Rebirth of the British Monarchy</b> by Paul Thomas Murphy, 512 pages (2012)</p> <p>This is what happens when none of the other really interesting suggestions on our poll makes a solid third place showing. <i>Shooting Victoria</i>, the organizer's wildcard selection, is on the calendar for August. (Note: Date has been moved from 8/31 to 8/3.)</p> <p>"Paul Thomas Murphy used to teach \u201ca variety of disciplines\u201d at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I would like to have been taught by him. He\u2019s the most free-spirited of scholars. \u201cShooting Victoria\u201d rambles uninhibitedly and learnedly through 19th-century history into literature, penology, constitutional theory and even ballistics, stimulating highly topical thoughts along the way."--John Sutherland, The New York Times</p> <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/books/review/shooting-victoria-by-paul-thomas-murphy.html?pagewanted=1"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/books/review/shooting-victoria-by-paul-thomas-murphy.html?pagewanted=1" class="linkified">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/books/review/shooting-victoria-by-paul-thomas-murphy.html?pagewanted=1</a></a></p> <p>"Written with as much verve and spirit as the youthful queen herself, this fascinating investigation into the attempted assassinations is a superb exploration into 19th-century construction of monarchy, police procedure and perceptions of madness. Murphy\u2019s infectious energy is a fit tribute to the inexhaustible monarch he paints with such detail and affection." \u2014BBC History Magazine</p> <p>"Gripping\u2026 Shooting Victoria is a teeming discursive pleasure. Murphy\u2019s book is a feat of historical sympathy, shining light on the larger picture of the 19th century and its indestructible queen." \u2014Observer</p> <p>"Fascinating\u2026Murphy\u2019s impressive work pulls together many strands of legal, social and political history. It is a testament to his talent that these 500 pages left me wanting more "\u2014The Daily Express</p> <p>"Murphy presents his tale with a superb sense of place, gleaned from many hours poring over maps and census records\u2026in a book for true lovers of the minutiae of the Victorian period "\u2014Sunday Telegraph</p> <p>And for fun, check out this "Shooting Victoria Tour" on the author's website: <a href="http://shootingvictoria.com/"><b><a href="http://shootingvictoria.com/" class="linkified">http://shootingvictoria.com/</a></b></a></p>

V<p>This moderately strenuous 6 mile loop starts and ends at the Stinson Beach fire station. We'll go up the Matt Davis trail to the Coastal trail; these two miles are extremely steep and include many steps. The intersection of the Coastal trail and Willow Camp fire road is a great place for lunch with stunning views of the ocean and Bolinas (fog permitting). From here it's about two miles downhill to Stinson Beach.</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/1/1/e/600_385185342.jpeg" /></p>

This place is wonderful...you will feel like you stepped into a little corner of Italy...sunshine, Frank Sinatra on the loudspeaker, a little bubbly, and bocce...ahhh!</p> <p><br/>I have reserved a court from 10am- 1pm. The staff will teach us the rules of the game when we first get started. Please wear soft-soled shoes. We can rotate teams (4 people per team) so folks can play as much or as little as they want.</p> <p>Please bring a brunch food item to share and whatever you would like to drink (other than champagne and juice). I will provide the champagne, juice, paper plates, napkins, cutlery, and cups.</p> <p>Cost: $15 includes 3 hours of court rental, champagne, juice, paper products, and tons of fun! Sorry, no refunds.</p> <p><br/>See you there!</p> <p>Andrea</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/7/0/600_372102352.jpeg" /></p>

V<p>TO ENTER YOUR DACHSHUND(S) IN THIS RACE, EMAIL DEAN SMITH, <a href="mailto:[masked]">[masked]</a> AND PROVIDE NAME, DACHSHUND(S) NAME, AND HE'LL SIGN YOU UP!</p> <p>Us Cheerleaders will be cheering your dog(s) on!</p> <p>The highly anticipated 11th Annual Dachshund Derby, The Highway Wiener Nationals, is planned for this year on Sunday, August 3rd, starting at 11:00am (be there by 10:30am).</p> <p>DACHSHUNDS ONLY will take to the lawn at Palo Alto High School to showcase their speed and race for the title. Our Nathan and Roo have participated in this race, and it was a lot of fun. Nathan has won a heat, but unfortunately at the next race he got so excited he just jumped in the air and twirled! Roo saw something he liked better and ran sideways! Neither one came close to the finish line, but it was very cute to watch. All participants are very gentle with their pups...</p> <p>If you don't want to enter your Dachshund in this fun, stress-free Dachshund race, bring your Dachshund(s) to watch the races - it's a real hoot.</p> <p>This FREE, Dachshund ONLY, 10th annual race will have 1st, 2nd, and 3rd prizes! Bring a little money to purchase an Event T-Shirt! Last year all Event participants got a free T-Shirt - hope that's true for this year too!</p>

V<p>This is going to be a recurring event, the first Sunday of every month through October. The San Pedro Square Market is a great venue with lots of picnic benches outside so we can enjoy our beautiful weather. There are lots of food and beverages choices and the outside area is also dog friendly. Feel free to bring your furry friend if they are well behaved.</p>

V<p>Let's take advantage of the beautiful weather, and enjoy some good food &amp; good company outdoors. This is a potluck event, and the theme is a luau, so fee free to bring your favorite Hawaiian snacks &amp; drinks (or anything else that you would like to bring to share). Please comment below what you are bringing, so we don't have too many repeated dishes. Also, please bring any board games, cards, or any other fun activities for the group to do together. We'll be at the tables in the shaded area by the playground, but I will post more specifics of the location on the day of. Looking forward to seeing you there!!</p>

V<p>Come and join BAGH and welcome Janice Magill aka "Abby Normal" and Eileen Cervantes (both members of BAGH) on Sunday, August 3rd, as they talk about their experiences of living in a very active haunted house and the strange directions it has taken their lives.</p> <p>I (Laura J) have investigated their house 3 times in the past and will be doing a follow-up investigation in the next few weeks along with an overnight stay, so I will be sharing some of my experiences also.</p> <p><b><i>This will be a dutch treat lunch.</i></b></p> <p><b>Some History:</b></p> <p>For most of Janice's adult life, she had chosen to believe that when you died that was the end. But one night she found out differently when a ghostly woman standing next to her bed awoke her and wanted her to deliver a message to a mutual friend. That event changed Janice's life forever.</p> <p><br/>Janice has discovered that she has some paranormal abilities and is learning to cope with them \u2013 and the spirits who know she has them, too. In looking for more insight she has interviewed some famous mediums and paranormal investigators including Amy Allen (<i>Dead Files</i>), Kim Russo (<i>The Haunting Of...</i>), Laura Lee (<i>Spirit Salon</i>), Jackie Barrett (<i>The</i> <i>Haunting of the Gemini, America's Psychic Challenge</i>), The Zodiac Girls and the cast of <i>Ghost Adventures</i>.</p> <p>In 2008, Eileen was a quasi-non-believer, wavering somewhere between "ghost stories are cool" and "it couldn't happen to me." While out house hunting, she found a house that was perfect on paper, except in person, it had a seriously negative feeling to it. Worried that Janice\u2013 an unwilling sensitive \u2013 would be uncomfortable in it, she walked away from it. That house became the basis for Eileen's novel, <i>House of Homicide</i>. Instead of buying the house that she thought <i>might</i> be haunted, she bought one that she fell in love with the moment she saw the listing - which turned out to be far more haunted than the first one. Destiny? Karma? </p> <p>For several years she ignored the strange happenings, but in 2013, an incident occurred that changed her life and her beliefs forever. </p> <p><i>Please welcome these guest speakers and enjoy lunch in this well known haunted location</i>. </p>

Does the potential of being in a group named "Team Midnight Buffet" or "Team Butt Cookies" excite you? If you've answered "yes" to any of these questions, you need to be a part of our games!</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aBall-kicking, base-running, (friendly) trash-talking, laughing, smiling, and f-u-n: that's what we and our games are all about.

V<p><b>POSTPONED due to double-booking. This is now on August 3rd.<br/></b></p> <p><b>Directions/meeting point</b>:<i><b>(the meetup.com directions linked above are not always reliable, use these details to find the start of the hike)</b></i> the meeting point will in Huddart County Park, <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/5MD4Q">in the main parking lot on Huddart Park Road</a>.   I will be driving my Silver Subaru Impreza WRX, license plate ending in 468.   I'll be wearing <a href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7166/6685655701_6ab329d4d9_b.jpg">this</a> black Sanzaru Games hoodie (if it's not too hot). I'll send out my cell to RSVPs (but as always there is no guarantee of reception).</p> <p>This week's hike is on the peninsula, starting at <a href="http://parks.smcgov.org/huddart-park">Huddart County Park</a>, and ending up in <a href="http://www.openspace.org/preserves/pr_purisima.asp">Purisma Creek</a>, before returning via Phleger Estate.  Exact route to be confirmed, but I expect it to be around 8 miles, with reasonable elevation gain..</p> <p>Dress in layers, bring lots of water and snacks.  Hopefully the weather will be good, but be prepared for rain and mud. Also be sure to avoid <a href="http://www.calflora.net/bloomingplants/westernpoisonoak.html">Poison Oak</a>, which can be found on most bay area trails.  We should be back well before sunset, but bring a flashlight just in case.  No dogs are allowed in these parks, unfortunately.</p> <p><br/>Carpooling recommended, as there is not a ton of parking at the trailhead.  I will be travelling from San Francisco and will have two spaces (email me via meetup if you are interested). There is a $6 parking fee at the park.</p> <p><br/><b>As with all my hikes everyone signs up at their own risk, and you assume all liability associated with the hike and carpooling to it (by RSVPing you agree to our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Golden-Gate-Hikers/pages/Conditions_of_membership/">conditions of membership</a>).</b></p> <p>If anyone fancies a post-hike beer and a snack, we'll be heading over to the &lt;a&gt;Freewheel Brewing&lt;/a&gt; in Redwood City after the hike.</p>

The buildings were constructed with wood framing, stucco outer walls, and corrogated metal roofing. The smallest units are 675 sq ft one-bedrooms; the largest are 1707 sq ft four-bedrooms.</p> <p>Each home has its own kitchen. The homes are owned individually as condominiums.</p> <p><b>Common Areas<img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/e/2/8/event_93696392.jpeg" /></b></p> <p>Our 3,835 sq ft Common House contains a kitchen, dining room ("great room"), sitting room, laundry, kids room, teens/older kids room, crafts room, guest rooms, bathrooms, and fireplace.</p> <p>The Common House is the only building in the project that has air conditioning. However to minimize the use of air conditioning, the building also has a cooling tower with large fans that can be used in the evening to pull cooler air into the building and push hot air out.</p> <p><a href="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/e/3/c/event_93696412.jpegOther" class="linkified">http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/e/3/c/event_93696412.jpegOther</a> common facilities include swimming pool, hot tub, large sandbox/play area, workshop, bike shed, organic garden, and granite boulders from original site - both decorative and used by children for climbing.</p> <p><b>Location</b></p> <p>We're conveniently located near Highway 680 and public transportation, with easy access to Walnut Creek, shopping, and recreation.</p> <p>Pleasant Hill, population 32,000, is located 30 miles east of San Francisco, 4 miles north of the I-680/Hwy 24 interchange. Mostly a residential community with scattered retail/commercial areas, it is bounded by the cities of Walnut Creek, Lafayette, Concord, and Martinez. Pleasant Hill has recently (2000) redeveloped its downtown to create a contemporary shopping district just blocks from the site. In addition, an abundance of good restaurants and shops are within easy driving distance. The city has good recreation programs for all ages and regional walking/biking trails traverse it.</p> <p> </p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/d/d/8/event_93696312.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>Iron Horse Trail</b></p> <p>A walking and biking trail - the Iron Horse Trail (<i>so named because it's on the old Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way</i>) - runs alongside the site and connects to the Pleasant Hill BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) station (~1 mile) and downtown Walnut Creek (~4 miles). The 24-mile trail goes north-south from Concord to Dublin and connects to several other trails that traverse the county making for great biking opportunities.</p> <p>A neighborhood park is located just the other side of Fair Oaks Elementary School adjacent to the site. Briones Regional Park and Mt. Diablo State Park are located nearby providing numerous opportunities for hiking and recreation. There are several health clubs in Pleasant Hill including the YMCA and Bally's (walking distance).</p> <p>Diablo Valley Community College and JFK University are located in Pleasant Hill, and there are several city and county adult education programs in the area.</p> <p>There are multiple venues nearby for movies, theater, music and other performing arts including a CineArts movie theater (art and independent films), the Dean Lesher Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek, the Willows Theater Company in Concord, and the Concord Pavillion.</p> <p>There are farmers markets in Pleasant Hill (May-Nov) and Walnut Creek (year-round). Several community members participate in a CSA farm, Terra Firma Farms, with a weekly delivery of locally grown organic fruits and vegies made even more convenient because we are the drop site.</p> <p> </p>

V<p>WHAT\u2019S IT ALL ABOUT?<br/>Shoppers (aka \u201cswappers\u201d) bring in GOOD quality women\u2019s, men\u2019s, and children\u2019s clothing and swap for other items brought by other swappers. Please remember that donated items are no longer yours.</p> <p>WHAT HAPPENS ONCE I ARRIVE?<br/>If you have clothes to drop-off:<br/>\u2022 Clothing drop-off time is from 2:00pm \u2013 4:00pm. \u2022 You\u2019ll have fun checking out the items and finding treasures to take home.</p> <p>If you do not have clothes to drop-off:<br/>\u2022 Arrive at the Clothing Swap from 4:30pm-5:30pm to find goodies.</p> <p>WHAT IF I DON\u2019T FIND MY SIZE/STYLE?<br/>Since we are dependent on the clothes brought in by others, we cannot guarantee you will find exactly what you are looking for (size and style) as the selection is based solely on what others bring in. Also, since this is not a \u201ctrade\u201d event, we cannot guarantee the amount of clothes you take will be equal to what you brought in.</p> <p>IT DOESN\u2019T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE WE ARE STILL GOING TO PARTY!!!</p> <p>WHAT SHOULD I BRING?<br/>Please bring at clean and gently-used clothing such as dresses, play clothes, pants, jackets, swimwear, shirts, hats, costumes and accesories. Bring shoes tied together.</p> <p>Please be mindful of other swappers and only bring clothes that you would want to bring home (i.e., no stains, holes, rips, or missing pieces). If you want to do a good deed and donate more clothes than you want in return, please bring do so! Other swappers will have more choices and your closets will be cleaner!</p> <p>There is no time limit for how long you can stay during the event hours, but we ask you to please take only what you need. Select only what you can use so everyone can have an enjoyable shopping experience too. We want this to be fun and satisfying opportunity for all our swappers!</p> <p>If two or more of you want the same item, the host will flip a coin, draw or rock/paper/scissors for the winner.<br/>We'll have music, food and drinks so be prepared to have fun.</p>

V<p>Expanding technology and social organization have enabled more people to live together in smaller spaces with fewer resources, but with better living conditions. However, this greater good for greater numbers can be punctuated by catastrophic famines, wars, and exterminations. What if this trend continued with an ever greater density of prosperous experience with cataclysmic nightmares? Live one such future through the eyes of a child whose misfortune gives him the skepticism to see the flaws and risks of his era. Could this one individual make the difference against a collapse of historic proportions?</p> <p>Please RSVP by June 30 and I'll send out the novel July 1st.</p>

V<p>From <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45882.Borderlands_La_Frontera">Goodreads</a>:</p> <p>"Anzaldua, a Chicana native of Texas, explores in prose and poetry the murky, precarious existence of those living on the frontier between cultures and languages. Writing in a lyrical mixture of Spanish and English that is her unique heritage, she meditates on the condition of Chicanos in Anglo culture, women in Hispanic culture, and lesbians in the straight world. Her essays and poems range over broad territory, moving from the plight of undocumented migrant workers to memories of her grandmother, from Aztec religion to the agony of writing. Anzaldua is a rebellious and willful talent who recognizes that life on the border, "life in the shadows," is vital territory for both literature and civilization. Venting her anger on all oppressors of people who are culturally or sexually different, the author has produced a powerful document that belongs in all collections with emphasis on Hispanic American or feminist issues."</p>

It is also mentioned in Book XVII of the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analects_of_Confucius">Analects of Confucius</a></i> and in two books written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mencius">Mencius</a> (c. 3rd century BC).</p> <p>Playing time (Casual): 20\u201390 minutes.  Random chance: None.  Skills required: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_strategy_and_tactics">Strategy</a>, tactics, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation">observation</a>.</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/6/600_344220182.jpeg" /></p> <p>Knights Templar Playing Chess, 1283</p> <p><b>Chess</b> is believed to have originated in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_India">Eastern India</a> during (c. 280 \u2013 550 CE) in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gupta_Empire">Gupta Empire</a>, where its early form in the 6th century was known as <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga">chatura\u1e45ga</a></i>, literally <i>four divisions</i> [of the military] \u2013 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry">infantry</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalry">cavalry</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_elephant">elephants</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariot">chariotry</a>, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.</p> <p><br/>Around 1200, the rules of shatranj started to be modified in southern Europe, and around 1475, several major changes made the game essentially as it is known today.  These modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in Italy and Spain. Pawns gained the option of advancing two squares on their first move, while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(chess)">queen</a> replaced the earlier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizier#Influence_on_chess">vizier</a> chess piece towards the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece.</p> <p><br/>Players: 2.  Playing time: 15 to 60 minutes.

The three dragon (cardinal) tiles also agree with the three cardinal virtues bequeathed by Confucius:  benevolence, sincerity, and filial piety.  Many historians believe it was based on a Chinese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_game">card game</a> called <i>M\u01cediào</i> (\u99ac\u540a) (also known as <i>Ma Tiae</i>, hanging horse; or <i>Yèzí</i> [\u8449\u5b50], leaf) in the early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty">Ming dynasty</a>.</p> <p><br/>This game was banned by the government of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China">People's Republic of China</a> when it took power in 1949. The new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism">Communist</a> government forbade any gambling activities, which were regarded as symbols of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism">capitalist</a> corruption. After the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>, the game was revived, without gambling elements, and the prohibition was revoked in 1985.</p> <p><br/>The game was imported to the United States in the 1920s. The first mahjong sets sold in the U.S. were sold by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abercrombie_%26_Fitch">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</a> starting in 1920.  It became a success in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, and the co-owner of the company, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Fitch">Ezra Fitch</a>, sent emissaries to Chinese villages to buy every mahjong set they could find.</p> <p><br/>Players: 2-4.  Playing time: 1-3 hours.  Random Chance: Light - shuffling. Skills required:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_strategy">Strategy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_tactics">tactics</a>, memory.</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/7/2/2/600_344225922.jpeg" /></p> <p>The <b>Royal Game of Ur</b>, also known as the <b>Game of Twenty Squares</b>, refers to an ancient game represented by two game boards found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur">Royal Tombs of Ur</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq">Iraq</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Woolley">Sir Leonard Woolley</a> in the 1920s. The two boards date from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_dynasty_of_Ur#Early_Dynastic_IIIa_period">First Dynasty of Ur</a>, before 2600 BC, thus making the Royal Game of Ur one of the oldest examples of board gaming equipment found, although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senet">Senet</a>boards found in Egyptian graves predate it as much as 900 years. The Ur-style Twenty Squares gameboard was also known in Egypt as <b>Asseb</b>, and has been found in Pharaoh <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamen">Tutankhamen</a>'s tomb, among other places. Discovery of a tablet partially describing the gameplay has allowed the game to be played again after over 2000 years, although reconstructions of the detailed rules have differed widely.</p> <p><br/>Players: 2.  Playing time: 20-50 minutes.  Random Chance: Medium (dice).  Skills required:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_strategy">Strategy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_tactics">tactics</a>.</p> <p>*****************</p> <p>I will be bringing all of these games to the event, and hopefully will be able to add more in the future!  Below is a pic of the front of the cafe and a map of the general location.  Plentiful parking is around the corner in the back (you can access the cafe from there - the building with the terraced patios).  </p> <p>There has been interest in making this a reoccurring event, so please check back if you are unable to go this time.</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/1/4/600_344226932.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/5/0/600_344226992.jpeg" /></p>

V<p>It's like a math equation! "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" + Free Ice Cream Social + Free Concert + Broadway Singers = One Wonderful Time!</p> <p>This is the last of the San Jose Symphony's free Summer Pops Concerts on the lawn at San Jose State University.  These are terrific events to picnic, socialize and listen to great music! </p> <p><br/>Tonight is The Cole Porter Songbook for a lyrical trip back to the 1930s and 1940s. A gifted composer and lyricist with a scandalous secret life, Porter handled both music and lyrics with ease, and conquered both Broadway and Hollywood with his witty songs.   His work includes "Night and Day," "Anything Goes," "I've Got You Under My Skin," "True Love," and of course "My Heart Belongs to Daddy."</p> <p><br/>SJSU has plastic chairs if you want to sit on those or you can bring your own or sit on the grass. You will want to get there a bit early to get the best space.</p> <p>PICNIC: 4:30 Bring food/snacks to share, wine, etc...</p> <p>PERFORMANCE: Begins at 5:30</p> <p>NOTE if you cannot locate the BAIC group please call my cell at [masked].</p>

V<p>This meetup is for intermediate/advanced players, rated 3.5 to 4.0. Players aspiring to 3.5 and wanting a challenge and learn are also welcome.</p> <p>In this meetup we play sets and try to improve match skills and competitiveness. Feedback to each other is welcome. We try to match players' skills.</p> <p>It's geared <i>mostly</i> for singles play, though we may play doubles if there aren't enough courts available.</p> <p>A fresh can of balls will be appreciated to play.</p> <p>You are encouraged to arrive early because these courts are very popular.</p> <p><br/><b>Waitlist:</b> What do you do if you are in the waitlist? You should <b>definitely plan to attend</b> the event, but <b>45 to 60 minutes from the start</b>. At that time, things start to ease and spots open up. We ask that you always <b>wait outside</b>, at the entrance, until the next re-shuffle of partners or a court opens up. In the rare event that there are a lot of people waiting due to lack of courts, confirmed RSVPs have priority, but even then we will try to shuffle everyone in.</p> <p>Please <b>avoid no-shows at all costs</b>. If you find you cannot attend, change your RSVP as early as possible to free one spot so that others can plan their day. No-shows will lead to not being allowed to participate in future events.</p> <p>Be prepared to have fun and being challenged playing!</p>

Pat Vornado on Bass\u2026..yes, THAT Pat Vornado. Russ \u201d solid\u201d Gold\u2026 out of Biscayne Bay, on drums. \u201cPretty\u201d Rick Dallas on Guitar, and Dan \u201d the man\u201d Kingsford on vocals, acoustic guitar and overall frontman-ness. If we are not at the Dojo, perfecting our kick-ass moves, you will find us in, on, or near the water, producing sweet sounds as smooth as the summer sea.</p> <p>Our mission, our destiny, is simple, to build a mustache army capable of creating a Soft Rock Explosion the likes of which has not been seen since the days when Christopher Cross, Steely Dan, Ace, Kenny Loggins and The Little River Band, to name but a few, created A.M.

V<p>So, mother nature seems to be hatin' on the Transplants (raining on our hikes, beating down 100 degrees on our book club) but, we are undaunted! The last book was well-received, the meeting was fairly attended (especially considering the weather) and we are marching onward with another book selection! <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Theory-Opposites-Allison-Winn-Scotch-ebook/dp/B00GGQ8YEQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402337234&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Theory+of+Opposites" class="linkified">http://smile.amazon.com/Theory-Opposites-Allison-Winn-Scotch-ebook/dp/B00GGQ8YEQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402337234&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Theory+of+Opposites</a></p> <p>Let's put a "Meet Up" time at about 5 weeks out. And, let's plan on meeting up at Heather Farms (in the spirit of exploration of our various 'hoods in conjunction with the reading / socializing). Also bumped it waaaaay back in time to help combat some of the summer heat. 6:45pm should give us plenty of light and I hope it doesn't affect people's decision to attend because of Monday AM work obligations. We will meet at the "Grassland" area of Heather Park (map link below), which is just "south" (in the image, not necessarily as a real-world directional) of the larger lake, by one of the parking facilities. Bring a blanket, a beverage of choice and a snack to share.</p> <p><img src="http://www.ci.walnut-creek.ca.us/images/about/quality_of_life/heatherpark_masterplan.jpg" /></p>

Though my daughter is an advanced reader, I have had previous challenges creating an environment where she would get into writing. <b>Shu-Hsien and Royd were able to get the group of kids to enthusiastically write.</b> Students shared their works at the end of the week with oral readings. <b>The teachers are excellent about using various strategies to tap into what works for the individual student</b> and <b>use interactive group work to start the thinking process</b> moving for the young writers....My <b>daughter came home from the workshop so happy and content</b>, the way she can be after a long stretch of time engrossed in an activity."<br/><b>  ~ Julie, Parent of 8-year-old writer</b></p> <p><b>Writing Coaches Shu-Hsien Ho and Royd Hatta</b> are passionate about teaching youth and teens how to organize their thoughts and write with power, clarity and ease. Since 1996, their students have learned to write essays, research reports, poems, short stories, and even their first novels. After working with Ms. Ho, one teen writer independently published her 400-page fantasy novel. Their students have gotten accepted into top colleges and universities, such as UC San Diego, Carnegie Mellon, Caltech, MIT, NYU, and Brown University. Ms. Ho has a B.A. from Pomona College and an M.A. from Lesley University. Mr. Hatta has a B.A. from the California State University at Long Beach, with specialties in history, art, theater, and philosophy. Ms. Ho and Mr. Hatta currently teach small group workshops for homeschooling groups and at the Chinese American International School in San Francisco. They run two thriving writers clubs with over 420 families: Bay Area Young Writers and Bay Area Teen Writers. In the last two years, Ms. Ho and Mr. Hatta published four anthologies of their students\u2019 fiction: <i>Strokes of Lightning</i>, <i>Real Heroes Wear Sneakers,</i> <i>Bones of Mystery,</i> and <i>Encroaching Ink</i>.

V<p>All, please join us for our next New Yorker Magazine Meet Up. Conversations are not limited to the New Yorker Magazine at all, but rather it is a gathering of like-minded people who enjoy the New Yorker Magazine to enjoy cocktails and socialize. We will talk about life, world events and anything else worthy of conversation over happy hour drinks.</p> <p>We try to pick a few articles each month for people to read. Here are this month's articles: </p> <p>A Very Rare Book<br/>The mystery surrounding a copy of Galileo\u2019s pivotal treatise.<br/><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/12/16/131216fa_fact_schmidle"><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/12/16/131216fa_fact_schmidle" class="linkified">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/12/16/131216fa_fact_schmidle</a></a></p> <p><br/>Auto-Correct<br/>Has the self-driving car at last arrived?<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/11/25/131125fa_fact_bilger"><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/11/25/131125fa_fact_bilger" class="linkified">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/11/25/131125fa_fact_bilger</a></a></p> <p>ROCKET MAN<br/>How an unemployed blogger confirmed that Syria had used chemical weapons.<br/><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/11/25/131125fa_fact_keefe"><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/11/25/131125fa_fact_keefe" class="linkified">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/11/25/131125fa_fact_keefe</a></a></p> <p>By popular demand, here is a FAQ for this Meet Up.</p> <p>Q: Is reading of the articles mandatory. </p> <p>A: No, No, and No. Please come even if you haven't. </p> <p>Q: I only look at the cartoons and never really read the articles. May I still attend?</p> <p>A: Yes.</p> <p>Q: I used to read the New Yorker but I haven't recently. May I still attend?</p> <p>A: Yes. We are about like-minded people getting together and socializing. There will be no test on recent issues.</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a </p>

V<p>Enjoy meatless Sri Lankan cuisine! Pearl of the Ocean offers organic food, many dishes with exotic ingredients that you can try! The owner is trained in Ayurvedic medicine and even has clients who come to her restaurant for healing food. Chef Ayoma Wilen is also the winner of the Best Chef America 2013 award!</p> <p><a href="http://www.pearloftheocean.net/" class="linkified">http://www.pearloftheocean.net/</a></p> <p><br/><a href="http://m.mainstreethub.com/pearloftheocean" class="linkified">http://m.mainstreethub.com/pearloftheocean</a></p> <p><br/><a href="http://www.facebook.com/PearlOfTheOceanCA"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/PearlOfTheOceanCA" class="linkified">http://www.facebook.com/PearlOfTheOceanCA</a></a> <i><br/></i></p> <p><i>There will be one check per table, so please bring cash if you can.</i></p> <p><br/><b>Help the Environment</b></p> <p>Eating with friends is fun, and even more fun if you're helping the environment at the same time. Reducing animal product consumption helps to reduce your personal contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and climate forcers, including carbon dioxide, methane, black carbon (soot), nitrous oxide, and tropospheric ozone. Plus, eating more veggies is good for you!</p> <p><b>RSVPs</b></p> <p>We'll make a reservation, so please RSVP and show up if you plan to go. To make sure our events are a success, if you're a no-show three times you won't be able to RSVP for the dinners anymore (it's nothing personal). Emergencies or illness aside, when you cancel at the last minute, that can mean some people who wanted to go couldn't, so that might be marked as well.</p> <p><br/><i>Be sure to check in with me so we can mark you as present on the RSVP list.</i> That way I won't accidentally mark you as a no-show. Things get a little crazy as people arrive so I could easily make a mistake.</p> <p><br/>Hope to see you there! Multiple meetup groups are attending. If you'd like to meet more people than you're sitting next to, feel free to walk around and mingle with other tables. There will be people with a variety of eating styles at the event; all we ask is that everyone be respectful and kind to each other, and order a meatless dish to help the environment.</p> <p><b>More Information About Meatless Monday</b></p> <p>Our normal Meatless Monday dinners are the <i>first Monday of the month at 6:30pm</i>. We might have other special dinners on other Mondays of the month.</p> <p>Here's more info about the international Meatless Monday campaign:<br/><a href="http://www.meatlessmonday.com/about-us/why-meatless/"><a href="http://www.meatlessmonday.com/about-us/why-meatless/" class="linkified">http://www.meatlessmonday.com/about-us/why-meatless/</a></a></p> <p>Here's the goal of the international Meatless Monday campaign, from their website:</p> <p>"Meatless Monday is a non-profit initiative of The Monday Campaigns, in association with the Johns Hopkins\u2019 Bloomberg School of Public Health. We provide the information and recipes you need to start each week with healthy, environmentally friendly meat-free alternatives. Our goal is to help you reduce your meat consumption by 15% in order to improve your personal health and the health of the planet."</p> <p>Here's a proclamation that the Santa Cruz County supervisors put together in support of Meatless Monday:<br/><a href="http://files.meetup.com/161345/MeatlessMondayProclamationSignedSCCsupervisors.pdf"><a href="http://files.meetup.com/161345/MeatlessMondayProclamationSignedSCCsupervisors.pdf" class="linkified">http://files.meetup.com/161345/MeatlessMondayProclamationSignedSCCsupervisors.pdf</a></a></p> <p>Here is the Meatless Monday Santa Cruz County Facebook page:</p> <p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/SCruzMM"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/SCruzMM" class="linkified">http://www.facebook.com/SCruzMM</a></a></p> <p><b>What Is Meat?</b></p> <p>This is a question I have been asked. For clarity, it is the flesh of animals (kingdom Animalia) as used for food. Feel free to look up this kingdom if you like; for example, it does include fish and various sea creatures.</p> <p><i>You come under your own liability to this event.</i></p>

To make sure our events are a success, if you're a no-show three times you won't be able to RSVP for the dinners anymore (it's nothing personal). Emergencies or illness aside, when you cancel at the last minute, that can mean some people who wanted to go couldn't, so that might be marked as well.</p> <p><br/><i>Be sure to check in with me so we can mark you as present on the RSVP list.</i> That way I won't accidentally mark you as a no-show. Things get a little crazy as people arrive so I could easily make a mistake.</p> <p><br/>Hope to see you there! Multiple meetup groups are attending. If you'd like to meet more people than you're sitting next to, feel free to walk around and mingle with other tables. There will be people with a variety of eating styles at the event; all we ask is that everyone be respectful and kind to each other, and order a meatless dish to help the environment.</p> <p><b>More Information About Meatless Monday</b></p> <p>Our normal Meatless Monday dinners are the <i>first Monday of the month at 6:30pm</i>. We might have other special dinners on other Mondays of the month.</p> <p><br/>Here's more info about the international Meatless Monday campaign:<br/><a href="http://www.meatlessmonday.com/about-us/why-meatless/"><a href="http://www.meatlessmonday.com/about-us/why-meatless/" class="linkified">http://www.meatlessmonday.com/about-us/why-meatless/</a></a></p> <p>Here's the goal of the international Meatless Monday campaign, from their website:</p> <p>"Meatless Monday is a non-profit initiative of The Monday Campaigns, in association with the Johns Hopkins\u2019 Bloomberg School of Public Health. We provide the information and recipes you need to start each week with healthy, environmentally friendly meat-free alternatives. Our goal is to help you reduce your meat consumption by 15% in order to improve your personal health and the health of the planet."</p> <p>Here's a proclamation that the Santa Cruz County supervisors put together in support of Meatless Monday:<br/><a href="http://files.meetup.com/161345/MeatlessMondayProclamationSignedSCCsupervisors.pdf"><a href="http://files.meetup.com/161345/MeatlessMondayProclamationSignedSCCsupervisors.pdf" class="linkified">http://files.meetup.com/161345/MeatlessMondayProclamationSignedSCCsupervisors.pdf</a></a></p> <p>Here is the Meatless Monday Santa Cruz County Facebook page:</p> <p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/SCruzMM"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/SCruzMM" class="linkified">http://www.facebook.com/SCruzMM</a></a></p> <p><b>What Is Meat?</b></p> <p>This is a question I have been asked. For clarity, it is the flesh of animals (kingdom Animalia) as used for food. Feel free to look up this kingdom if you like; for example, it does include fish and various sea creatures.</p> <p><i>You come under your own liability to this event.</i></p>

V<p>Welcome to the new and improved community crafting event!  This free meetup returns to Santa Clara. </p> <p> </p> <p>Since so many of our extremely talented members have many and various types of crafts to do, including the paper arts, drawing, stamping, card making, scrap booking, quilting, embroidery, knitting, and jewelry making, we've decided to rename these free nights of crafting as "Community Crafting" nights, rather than knitting, needles or jewelry.</p> <p> </p> <p>So, we now welcome ALL crafters to the community room on the first and third Mondays of the month to share your craft, your art, and your projects with all of us!!  Show us your stuff, and bring your great crafts to the meetup!</p> <p> </p> <p>Although this is a FREE meetup, we do ask that everyone please keep their RSVP's updated at all times.  There is limited space in this meetup and its not fair for anyone to RSVP and never show up.  Please know that if you can with less than 5 days notice to the host, you will be given an attendance violation for the year.  Repeated offenses can result in removal from the group.  Please remember the rules and keep your RSVPs updated at all times.  thanks!</p>

V<p>For the Mountain View folks who can't make it to San Jose, and for everyone else too, Mondays at Peet's on Castro seem pretty nice!</p> <p>All levels welcome\u2014come knitters, come crocheters, or just come by and say hello. If you've never knit (or crocheted) before, just bring a set of needles (or a hook or a loom) and some yarn, we can get you started.</p> <p>This venue has a parking lot next door (it's on the not-so-busy part of Castro Street). It does close at 9 but they're friendly about asking us to leave. We'll do introductions &amp; show-and-tell around 8 o'clock, so bring along any finished objects you like and we'll ooh and aah over them.</p> <p>** The meetup is free as always, but it's nice to buy a drink or snack at Peet's since they're so nice about letting us use the space. **</p>

V<p>Join the San Francisco Travel Book Club on Monday, August 4th when we will discuss The Great Railway Bazaar, by Paul Theroux</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/4/c/600_366019532.jpeg" /></p> <p>Description from Amazon.com<br/>First published more than thirty years ago, Paul Theroux's strange, unique, and hugely entertaining railway odyssey has become a modern classic of travel literature. Here Theroux recounts his early adventures on an unusual grand continental tour. Asia's fabled trains -- the Orient Express, the Khyber Pass Local, the Frontier Mail, the Golden Arrow to Kuala Lumpur, the Mandalay Express, the Trans-Siberian Express -- are the stars of a journey that takes him on a loop eastbound from London's Victoria Station to Tokyo Central, then back from Japan on the Trans-Siberian. Brimming with Theroux's signature humor and wry observations, this engrossing chronicle is essential reading for both the ardent adventurer and the armchair traveler</p>

V<p>This group has been set up to provide project managers in the PMI-SFBAC region with support while they are looking for new career opportunities.  </p> <p>It will be held twice a month (every 1st and 3rd Tuesday, from 7:30am-9:00am) in San Francisco - for location details see above.  </p> <p>The meeting will be open to currently unemployed project management professionals as well as those in search of a new position while still being employed.  </p> <p>If there is interest from either side, representatives from recruiting and contracting agencies can be invited to give an overview of the current market situation, special skills that are in high demand, and potential trends.</p> <p>During the events participants will:</p> <p>\u2022 Share information on useful websites, job search opportunities, social media</p> <p>\u2022 Discuss current project management as well as recruiting trends</p> <p>\u2022 Initiate peer reviews on their own CV and/or online presence (e.g. website, LinkedIn)</p> <p>The \u2018PMI-SFBAC \u2013 Job Search Group\u2019 will provide the attendees with much needed face-to-face support while they are trying to accomplish one of the most difficult tasks in their work life:  finding a new position where they can apply and develop their project management skills.</p> <p><br/><b>Note for Recuiters:</b></p> <p>Please note that this meeting is for project managers who are looking for new job opportunity and who want to discuss the way to get there!</p> <p>As much as we are happy to connect with you, it does not make sense for you to spend 90 minutes in this meeting - and to take up a seat from somebody who potentially would like to join and now has been put on the waiting list.  We are more than happy to have us join for the last 15 minutes of any future meeting, but we would like to coordinate that.</p> <p>Please contact the meeting host upfront through this website - by clicking on the name and then 'Send email'.  We will get back to you asap and arrange an appropriate time and date.</p> <p>Thank You!</p>

V<p>This is the second of a two part class on website development. In this class you will learn how to use the Bootstrap Framework to make a good looking website. Bootstrap is the most popular frontend framework and will save you time in developing a site. This class assumes you either attended the earlier class on HTML and CSS, or are otherwise already familiar with HTML and CSS. You need to bring a laptop computer with a text editor installed. If you don't already have a text editor, please download and install either Notepad++ for PC or Text Wrangler for Mac before attending the class. Both are free and work very well.<br/>This class is taught as a hands on workshop. You will actually be creating a website on your computer during this class. You will access the code from the internet.</p>

V<p>Ready for more white-boarding, technical puzzlers and mock interviews? The folks at <a href="https://www.urbansitter.com/">UrbanSitter</a> are kindly hosting and will provide pizza. So come join us for whatever technical interview tasks you want to work on. </p> <p>The format is as usual:</p> <p>We start with a quick meet &amp; greet before breaking in to pairs.</p> <p>Each pair will take turns as interviewer and interviewee. The interviewer will spend a few minutes asking the interviewee about their resume, experience and what they are looking for in a role. Then they spend 20 minutes or so posing a technical coding question, and reviewing the solution. Then, the pair switch roles. Pairs are, of course, welcome to change it up to suit their own needs.</p> <p>After each round, we can change partners and we aim to get through 2 to 3 rounds in the evening.</p> <p>Please come prepared with:</p> <p>* A friendly and inquisitive attitude!</p> <p>* A copy of your resume for the 'interviewer' to review and discuss</p> <p>* Some 'puzzler' type questions that are typical in tech interviews; Ideally questions you know the answers to! We will provide some too.</p> <p>Feel free to bring business/contact cards too. Networking is your best tool to find that next role!</p> <p>Doors open at 5:45 and we start at 6:00. Looking forward to seeing you all there!</p> <p>Shaun</p> <p>PS Our hosts at UrbanSitter are hiring! Feel free to check their <a href="https://www.urbansitter.com/careers">jobs section</a>. An engineer will be available on site should you have any questions. </p>

V<p><i>RAFT's mission is to help educators transform the learning experience through hands-on education that inspires the joy and discovery of learning. Hands-on education translates abstract and complex subjects into activities that young learners, literally, can grasp, and nurtures their natural inquisitive and interactive traits. RAFT develops innovative hands-on project idea sheets and pre-packaged activity kits created around important concepts in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) as well as reading and art.</i></p> <p><i>Volunteering at RAFT is a fun, easy and convenient way to support local teachers. RAFT's products, services and low-cost teaching supplies enrich and improve the education of over 825,000 young people each year. Volunteers help keep the cost of RAFT products affordable for educators by sorting the different raw materials that are donated and packaging RAFT hands-on learning activity kits.</i></p> <p><br/><b>When: 6:00pm-8:00pm. Please arrive on time and plan to stay for the entire shift.</b></p> <p><b>All volunteers must be at least 18 years old.<br/></b></p> <p><b>If you would like to bring a guest/friend with you, please have them sign up with their own account through Meetup.</b></p> <p><b>Casual Dress and close toed shoes are recommended.

V<p>It's time again for some blue grass music and the best smoked ribs and BBQ fare -- at Sam's. Every Tuesday and Wednesday night, there's free music, and on this date, the great Bean Creek is playing. </p> <p>Sam's offers slow smoked BBQ ribs (I love their baby back rack), plus numerous other choices like juicy smoked chicken, burgers (also turkey and veggie options) topped with Pt. Reyes blue, hush puppies, well, you get the picture. There are vegetarian options, but this is a meaty BBQ place and not for the faint of heart. For more info, go to &lt;a&gt;www.samsbbq.com.&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><br/>RSVP ASAP as I'll need to reserve table space on the patio way in advance. </p> <p><br/>Nothing like comfort food plus happy music to keep up the spirits.</p>

V<p>Please come and play board games at Panera Bread (in the Concord Willows Shopping Center). Theme- the 70's: peace signs, tie dye, bandannas, Burkenstock's, flowy skirts/shirts, smiley faces and/or flower power. The theme is optional.</p> <p>I will bring between 8-15 party/social/strategy/two person games to shared. Please bring a game or two to share.  I will supply name tags (this time, lol), pens, pencils and tons of scratch paper.  This group tends to eat prior to game play. If you decide not to eat, look for others that are "ready for game time".</p> <p>Also, Panera Bread has a PaneraCard.  Just go to the counter, ask for a card, register it at home and your next visit you will have a free pastry.  Of course the more money you spend the more offers you will be receiving.  Plus, each full meal you purchase, you have the option to purchase a pastry for 99 cents.  Finally, Costco offers gift certificates (2) $25 for only $39.00 which you can utilize at any Panera Bread. The Costco in Concord definitely has Panera Bread gift cards. </p> <p>Just look for me or the East Bay Board Gamers "table tent".</p> <p>I hope to see you all soon.</p> <p>Jennifer (host)<br/>cell-[masked]</p>

More info and Rich's bio is below.</p> <p>We are going to be gathering in the social lounge of the Paramount (special thanks to Kate for arranging this!) which will be a better venue to have a group discussion. This is just a few minute walk from the Montgomery BART station, and above the Grove.</p> <p><br/>Please feel free to bring your favorite drink and/or snacks to share so we'll make it our own private happy hour. Hope to see you there!</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a"Ask the Dive Travel Expert"<br/>Presented By Richard Woulfe</p> <p>This is your opportunity to ask any dive travel or general travel question. Come join Rich Woulfe of RichTravels as he answers interesting questions about numerous travel topics. Dive travel planning is an exciting and dynamic process. With the right strategies and tools, the planning and travel itself can be enjoyable and result in hundreds of dollars in savings.</p> <p>Richard has over 32 years of dive travel experience. In 2012 he was on the road over 300 days in over 20 countries and stayed in over 100 hotels/resorts. Rich has dived in over 100 destinations around the world.

V<p>Thirty years after women became 50 percent of the college graduates in the United States, men still hold the vast majority of leadership positions in government and industry. This means that women\u2019s voices are still not heard equally in the decisions that most affect our lives. In Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg examines why women\u2019s progress in achieving leadership roles has stalled, explains the root causes, and offers compelling, commonsense solutions that can empower women to achieve their full potential. </p> <p><br/>Sandberg is the chief operating officer of Facebook and is ranked onFortune\u2019s list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business and as one ofTime\u2019s 100 Most Influential People in the World. In 2010, she gave an electrifying TEDTalk in which she described how women unintentionally hold themselves back in their careers. Her talk, which became a phenomenon and has been viewed more than two million times, encouraged women to \u201csit at the table,\u201d seek challenges, take risks, and pursue their goals with gusto.</p> <p><br/>In Lean In, Sandberg digs deeper into these issues, combining personal anecdotes, hard data, and compelling research to cut through the layers of ambiguity and bias surrounding the lives and choices of working women. She recounts her own decisions, mistakes, and daily struggles to make the right choices for herself, her career, and her family. She provides practical advice on negotiation techniques, mentorship, and building a satisfying career, urging women to set boundaries and to abandon the myth of \u201chaving it all.\u201d  She describes specific steps women can take to combine professional achievement with personal fulfillment and demonstrates how men can benefit by supporting women in the workplace and at home. </p> <p><br/>Written with both humor and wisdom, Sandberg\u2019s book is an inspiring call to action and a blueprint for individual growth. Lean In is destined to change the conversation from what women can\u2019t do to what they can.</p> <p><img src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1364250803l/16071764.jpg" /></p>

V<p>Imagine a street (in this case a cul-de-sac) blocked off to traffic and reserved for a block party type of event - anchored by a drum circle..... our drum circle. Residents of the neighborhood will be invited to attend to meet their neighbors, have a snack, and listen to the music that we produce in our drum circle ..... and they will be welcome to join in.</p> <p>It's all part of "National Night Out" and the following text is from their press release at <a href="http://www.natw.org/resources/press-release/" class="linkified">http://www.natw.org/resources/press-release/</a></p> <p>The National Association of Town Watch (NATW) has announced that the \u201c29th Annual National Night Out (NNO) program will culminate on Tuesday, August 6, 2013.</p> <p>National Night Out, a year-long community building campaign, is designed to: (1) Heighten crime prevention awareness; (2) Generate support for, and participation in, local anticrime programs; (3) Strengthen neighborhood spirit and police-community partnerships; and (4) Send a message to criminals letting them know that neighborhoods are organized and fighting back.</p> <p>Along with the traditional outside lights and front porch vigils, most cities and towns celebrate National Night Out with a variety of special citywide and neighborhood events such as block parties, cookouts, parades, festivals, visits from local officials and law enforcement, safety fairs, and youth events.</p> <p>The city of Santa Clara is supporting NNO and there is no cost. I have the permit for the street closure. I'll ask residents to bring a dessert or beverage to share. Our drum circle group will supply the instruments to play.</p> <p><br/>So, if an evening of drumming on a well lit street as part of a neighborhood block party sounds interesting, <b>please RSVP so we will have a good strong group</b>. 20 or more would be fantastic.</p> <p><br/>Handicap access is easy. Dogs allowed. Restrooms available in my house. Extra drums and percussion instruments are usually available but not guaranteed.</p>

Bring your receipt, please.</p> <p>**(in order of arrival; due to meeting time, there is a small possibility there won't be enough time for all people to be read, depending on the number of people in attendance.)</p> <p>Class teacher &amp; channeler is me, Kim Kristiansson. I've been teaching since the 1980's. I am a professional psychic &amp; medium. I was 15 before I found out everyone didn't use their intuition! My only reaction was, "<i>Why not??!!"</i></p> <p>Intrigued by this, I started my (ongoing) investigation &amp; study of metaphysics, philosophy, &amp; humankind's Quest for spiritual connection. I come from a family who took psychic happenings in stride (I am a 7th generation clairsentient on my mother's side) &amp; a Catholic going to Catholic school. The Universe had me live in high-energy environments (i.e. over a former POW camp in Guam &amp; in a Berlin barracks -site of a bloody coup attempt between different factions of Nazis). I often spontaneously channeled at some length - details that couldn't be found any other apparent way. Neither of these things were explained or encouraged by Church doctrine -So I kept investigating - &amp; practicing. My studies took me more than half-way around the world, to many disciplines &amp; several renowned &amp; wise teachers, including one of Sylvia Browne's mentors, &amp; being "adopted" by a hereditary Kahuna while still in grade-school. I am grateful to Charlie, Kevin Reyerson, S. Bartlett, Hans King &amp; Nick Nocerino for their guidance &amp; encouragement. I also studied with the Spiritual Science Church. Every night since I was three, my mother would practice telepathy with me, using a deck of playing cards at the kitchen table. Since all the neighborhood kids' moms played Bridge, I thought everyone played the "telepathy game" after dinner. Boy, was I surprised! I was in my 40's when I found out there was a trick to a magic trick which was popular in my childhood; until then, I thought you picked the correct card by intuition &amp; psychometry. After doing Palmistry, I moved to doing Psychometry (reading energy off of objects -from car keys to Stonehenge stones), &amp; now do what are called "Cold Readings" (reading the energy of the person or events without the aid of anything else, such as Tarot, crystal balls, etc.)</p> <p>I have used my psychic &amp; remote viewing capabilities for police, the National Security Agency, Military Intelligence, and other Agencies.</p> <p>I feel strongly that intuition is a powerful tool in daily but most of us have not been guided to develop it or taught how to trust our own abilities.</p> <p>For more info: <a href="http://www.WhispersInTheWinds.com">www.WhispersInTheWinds.com</a>. Our purpose is a focused gathering to share in spiritual awareness and most importantly, the awareness of your own connectedness. A safe place for practice &amp; validation of your own innate psychic &amp; metaphysical abilities. Intuition is a powerful tool in daily life &amp; as magical &amp; ordinary as any of our senses, but most of us have not been guided to develop it or taught how to trust our own abilities. In this new century, it is becoming essential for us all to live the most balanced and integrated lives possible. In Authentic and compassionate living, it is necessary to synthesize wisdom, logic &amp; feeling, as well as deepening understanding.</p> <p>For more info: <a href="http://www.whispersinthewinds.com/">www.WhispersInTheWinds.com</a></p>

V<p>The group meets at the Palo Alto Art Center, <a href="http://www.paacf.org/"><a href="http://www.paacf.org/" class="linkified">http://www.paacf.org/</a></a>, which is located at 1313 Newell Road, Palo Alto.</p> <p>The models come from the Palo Alto Models Guild.  Unfortunately they don't have a web site but do have a facebook page, but they are a long standing source of artists' models for the San Francisco Bay Area.  They range in age and body type making for an interesting and different experience everytime you go.</p> <p>Model time is 7:15 pm and ends at 9:45.  We begin with five 2 minute poses and two 5 minute poses, then we go to two 10 minutes poses.  After these, each pose last 20 minutes untill the end of the night.  There is a short break every 20 minutes and tipping the model is very much encouraged.</p> <p>Dry and water based mediums are most appreciated, as these are the easiest to clean up.  This being an interim facility an appreciation and respect of these borrowed facilities is needed so we do not lose the use of this space.  We all pitch in at the end of the session in order to put the facility back into its previous or better condition.</p> <p>All that being said, please come and enjoy yourself, while stretching your figure drawing legs. </p>

V<p><b>20% off</b> <b>at Bookshop Santa Cruz for best sellers, or 15% off</b> if you mention Ravenous Readers at the register or take the book off the book club wall. (It has a little tag in it for the cashier.) </p> <p>IMPORTANT NOTICE: Please bring $4 cash to pay for the room rental. You can bring water, or any non-alcoholic beverage, to drink during the meeting, and any snacks you want to share.</p> <p><b>From Goodreads.com:</b></p> <p>There is a clarity, elegance, and beauty to Conway's Road From Coorain that places it firmly at the apogee of autobiography along with such masterpieces as <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1624.West_With_the_Night">West With the Night</a> by Beryl Markham, or <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12528.An_American_Childhood">An American Childhood</a> , by Annie Dillard.</p> <p>From the first sentence, you will be drawn inexorably into the story of her childhood in New South Wales, Australia, and her gradual discovery of\u2014and by\u2014the larger world: the clarity of Conway's language satisfies like cold clear water after a day in the desert: the rhythm of her sentences has a timelessness and expansiveness akin to the Australian landscape itself. This is very likely a book you will remember the rest of your life. </p> <p><br/><b>From Publishers Weekly:</b></p> <p>At age 11, Conway left the arduous life on her family's sheep farm in the Australian outback for school in war-time Sydney, burdened by an emotionally dependent, recently widowed mother. A lively curiosity and penetrating intellect illuminate this unusually objective account of the author's progress from a solitary childhood--the most appealing part of the narrative--to public achievement as president of Smith College and now professor at MIT. Gifted with an ability to adapt to a wide range of cultures and people and despite ingrained Australian prejudice against intellectuals, Conway devoted herself to the study of history and literature, spurred on by excellent British-style schooling.</p>

V<p>We will be heading to Beerhall (on Polk and Market) for a happy hour where we can talk 3D over beer.  The Beerhall is an excellent beer bar (who also have a good wine selection).  This is a chance to meet other 3D professionals (and anyone who is interested in the subject) and talk about anything 3D related (or not 3D related for that matter!).</p> <p><br/>Look for a meetup sign to find us, we'll most likely be at a table near the back.</p>

V<p>At QSXX #5, we enjoyed seeing Dana's google form tracking project about grief and memory. I'd love to see more of what everyone is working on! If you would like to present, please get in touch.</p> <p>Also, I'd love to have more show and tell of incomplete/in progress projects so that we know what everyone is up to. Are there 5 people who would like to show and tell for just 2 minutes about something they are working on? I would collect a slide or two ahead of time for time efficiency.</p> <p>As usual, expect informal time to chat with a great group of ladies!</p>

V<p><b>Speaker</b>: Juval Löwy</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a<b>Abstract</b>: The sad reality is that Agile in the wild is often abused as a cynical way of avoiding the right things. Other times teams just go through the motions, having no idea what they mean. More than a decade after the Agile Manifesto, as an industry, we are no better off. Many have never seen a good Agile project that meet its commitments or promises, and bad Agile lets people assume that because they can't do it then it can't be done. Without knowing the true cost and schedule of the project, companies cannot make educated decisions and are literally playing poker without looking at the cards. Furthermore, poor Agile lets practitioners skirt the issue of not knowing how to do system and project design, pretend design is not needed or is even bad. In this candid, somber, and entertaining session Juval will reflect on what is wrong with the common way of doing Agile, identify the fallacies and misconceptions, the consequences of bad Agile, explain why people fail to do it right, the patterns the fall into, and what you can and must do about it, to prosper and BE agile. Juval will show how combining Agile with architecture and project design yields an excellent construction process delivering on schedule and on budget every time. </p> <p><br/><b>Note</b>: Upon arrival at Intel, park on the 2nd level of parking garage D behind building SC12. Follow the connecting bridge from the garage to the security desk for guest check in. Guest check in requires identification and an Intel employee (Robert Zych).</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/9/8/a/600_292843402.jpeg" /></p>

V<p>TurnON: [turn{on}]  </p> <p><br/>verb (something that happens in the body)</p> <p>To raise the body heat, leaving the individual feeling as though they may perspire</p> <p>To feel tingles in random parts of the body, letting the individual know those parts are awake</p> <p>To encounter cheeks getting flushed, often leaving the individual feel seen</p> <p>To ignite, as to feel more alive and alert</p> <p>TurnON occurs from many different things. Maybe you saw someone you thought was cute. Maybe you had an inappropriate thought cross your mind.</p> <p>Maybe you saw something that inspired or even pissed you off. Many things/people/conversations leave us with this ignited feeling in our body. (yes, deep down we all like the feeling of TurnON!) You know it's TurnON because it ignites -- as though your body is giving you a cue, shouting out "I'm ALIVE in here"!</p> <p>TurnON leaves you feeling more alert, ignited and happy.</p> <p>At OneTaste, we believe TurnON is the ignition that leads to a more of what we really want in life. We believe it is the first step to knowing what is possible.</p> <p>So, we started an evening event designed specifically to give people the opportunity to feel TurnON in themselves. (p.s., it's totally PG-13) It's an evening where, through only talking, we begin to experience these exhilarating, normal, often ignored feelings -- referred to as TurnON. A room of people (cool, fun people) engage in honest, humorous, playful conversation around topics we mostly only consider having in our head.</p> <p>TurnOn leads to authenticity and authenticity leads to the kind of connection we hope for around the globe.</p> <p>The evening leaves you invigorated, happy and inspired. We are meant to live TurnedON.</p> <p><i><br/></i></p> <p><i>Details:</i><br/>Singles &amp; Couples Welcome<br/>This event is $10</p> <p> </p>

He is a regular round table guest on the E! late night talk show Chelsea Lately, and has been appearing on the show since January 2008.  He is a frequent guest on KPCC (Southern California's NPR affiliate) on the Patt Morrison Program, bringing his comedic spin to political issues. He also reported for KPCC live from the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. He starred in the NBC series The Real Wedding Crashers, a prime time comedy that aired on the network Mondays at 10pm, with the show Heroes as a lead-in. The show also aired on BRAVO and STYLE Network. In 2009 he performed his standup on NBC's Last Call with Carson Daly, and in 2008, Gleib was featured on the NBC competition show Last Comic Standing. He is known for covering a wide range of topics in his act, including political and social commentary, but is also known for his improvisational skills, often making up large sections of his performance based on interactions with the crowd. A recent review of his stand up said "His persona has evolved to a satirical high...his act is laden with material that pays every time.\u201c In 2006, he sold a pilot called The Gleib Show to Fox, produced by Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels, Broadway Video, and NBC/Universal. This show was based on a TV show that Gleib directed, wrote, and starred in for three seasons on the National Lampoon Network from 2003\u20132005, which aired to college campuses across the country, and was consistently the network's number one show. It was also written and produced by Scot Richardson. The show was based on a show of the same title that Gleib did for four years during his time as an undergrad at the University of California, San Diego. At UCSD he studied Communications and Theater, and graduated in the Honors Thesis Program. He was a commencement speaker at his graduation. Ben Gleib appears in a supporting role in the feature film Bar Starz, which had a limited theatrical release. The film also featured Charlie Murphy, Daniel Franceze, Derek Waters, John Bernthal, and Nikki Griffin. In addition, Gleib has performed on The Late Late Show on CBS, at the Vancouver Comedy Festival, the Laughing Matters Festival in the Netherlands, hosted several pods for Current TV, and in 2002 wrote the "Radio Music Awards" for ABC.</p> <p>If you haven't seen an "American Me Comedy Show" then you're definitely missing out! Very funny line-up of comics will be performing including myself! We've had comics that have been on Comedy Central, HBO, Showtime, The Late Show With David Letterman, The Tonight Show, Conan, The Late, Late, Show With Craig Ferguson, America's Got Talent, and regulars on Chelsea Lately so make sure to catch this show because you never know who might pop in!!!</p> <p>American Me Comedy will be an evening of the best stand up comedy featuring today's hottest working comics from all walks of life - race, color, religion, sexual orientation - sharing their unique and hilarious perspectives on life experiences.</p> <p><b>SEATING IS ON A FIRST COME BASIS!</b></p> <p>Date and Time:<br/>Tuesday<br/>August 5, 2014<br/>8:00pm - 10:00pm<br/>Doors open : 7:00pm</p> <p>Location:<br/>Punch Line<br/>444 BatteryStreet                                                                                            San Francisco CA, 94111</p> <p><br/>Tickets:<br/>FREE SAY MEET UP AT THE BOX OFFICE WINDOW</p> <p>SEATING IS ON A FIRST COME BASIS.</p> <p><br/>2 drink minimum purchase required</p> <p>18+</p>

V<p>Jason Wyman leads sales and operations for FranklInCovey in the South Bay Area. FranklinCovey provides workshops, consulting and coaching to help individuals and organizations become more effective. They provide solutions in six key areas: leadership, trust, strategy execution, sales performance, customer loyalty and productivity.</p> <p>At the August 6th networking event, Jason will provide a 30-60 minute concept overview and lead a discussion based on FranklinCovey\u2019s 5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity. We will explore a central theme of our modern working lives: \u201cTechnology has made it easier than ever, and harder than ever, to be productive.\u201d When we deliberately pay attention to the most important things amidst the distractions, we can harness the opportunities and technologies available today and soar to creative and innovative heights.</p> <p><a href="http://www.franklincovey.com/tc/solutions/productivity-solutions/the-5-choices-to-extraordinary-productivity" class="linkified">http://www.franklincovey.com/tc/solutions/productivity-solutions/the-5-choices-to-extraordinary-productivity</a></p>

We welcome anyone to attend a GoRampUp! meeting, once, for free as our guest, so you can learn what the innovative GoRampUp! business-networking experience is all about. Note, we are not able to give you a free meeting at more than one of our many locations.</p> <p>YOU MUST obtain a free-access GoRampUp! Golden ticket by registering for a specific meeting at<a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar/"><a href="http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/" class="linkified">http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/</a></a>. This ticket must be presented at your complimentary meeting for you to gain admittance. Without this ticket you will, unfortunately, be declined access to our innovative and exclusive business-networking meeting. WITH a GoRampUp! Golden Ticket, you will be welcomed with open arms!</p> <p>It can be too difficult to attract new clients. We help you fix that! We're a business-impact community. We're informal and fun, yet, by design, we're extremely effective!</p> <p>We help people who work for a living to get a much greater payoff from working. We do this in three specific ways under our three CoreSuccess Platforms: 1) We help you move toward mastery with business-networking, 2) We help you move toward mastery with business performance, and, 3) We help you move toward mastery with personal development.</p> <p>How do we deliver on this promise to our community members? Each month we conduct dozens of business-networking meetings in more than a dozen cities in the SF Bay Area. A member may attend all of our "OpenConnect" business-networking meetings. And our members are welcome and encouraged to attend any and all of these meetings and locations.</p> <p>Each month we introduce and emphasize a learning and development subject under each of our three CoreSuccess Platforms. For each of the three learning and development subjects that we introduce and emphasize each month, we give you four different ways to learn it: We produce written learning guides, video learning guides, audio learning guide, and we cover the subjects as 15-to-20-minute mini-workshops inside of our 60-minute business-networking meetings. There's no registration or initiation fee to join. Membership in GoRampUp! is month to month. You enroll when you like, even mid-month, and you depart when you like.</p> <p>Be sure to see our website to learn about <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/growrampup">our generous enrollment incentives</a></p> <p>Also, be sure to learn about our <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/norisk">100-Satisfaction Money-Back Guarantee</a></p> <p>Would you care to come to this meeting, at no cost, to see if there\u2019s business-value for you?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">Free-Meeting Guest-RSVP and Golden Ticket Request</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">View complete meeting details</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/invite">Invite a Buddy to join you</a></p> <p>One last thing: You REALLY should check out actual testimonial videos by our members: <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/why">See them here</a></p> <p>This page was created to produce awareness of our event.

We welcome new as well as established business owners and like professionals to visit our weekly networking luncheon.  Everyone is given the opportunity to make a brief presentation or "infomercial", allowing the group to better understand and appreciate his/her business.  We encourage visitors to come early to take advantage of our networking session before we sit down, and afterward as well. Bring plenty of business cards!  We appreciate knowing at least a day in advance if a visitor is coming, to make certain we can accommodate everyone.  There is a fee of $25 per person which includes an outstanding buffet luncheon with meat as well as vegetarian entrees.  See ya all then!</p>

V<p>This is a weekly Wednesday meet-up held in Sunnyvale.</p> <p>Due to the popularity of these local courts after 6:00 p.m., we'll start at 5:30 p.m. Please try to arrive on time to help us secure as many courts as possible.</p> <p>If you don't see us when you arrived at Mango courts during the busy USTA leagues seasons, look for us at our <b>alternative location at "Fremont High School", 1279 Sunnyvale Saratoga Rd., Sunnyvale, CA 94087</b></p> <p><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl" class="linkified">https://maps.google.com/maps?hl</a>=...</p> <p><img src="http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/clear.gif" /></p> <p>Please be sure to RSVP, and kindly remember to update them in a timely manner should your plans changed, <b>preferably by noon. (Members with a history of no-shows or last minute cancellations will be removed from my future invitation and event lists).</b></p> <p>Should you plan to arrive later than the scheduled time, please mention it along with your RSVPs, but keep in mind that if you are more than a half hour late, you may lose your spot to a waiting list member. Also note that you may or may not be able to play beyond one hour depending on how busy the courts are.</p> <p>Members who are on the waiting list are welcome to come out and check to see if there are spaces available around 7:00 since we normally play until about 9 or 9:30. Priority will be applied according to the order of your RSVP.</p> <p>Rain cancel, unless the courts have had some time to dry.</p> <p>We appreciate everyone's contributions of tennis balls.</p> <p>Thanks! See you all on the courts!</p> <p><b>Mary is hosting</b></p> <p><img src="http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif" /></p>

V<p><b>Pssst!</b> This hack night is cosponsored with the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tinderbox">Tinderbox</a> meetup. Check out Tinderbox for additional information about our hack nights and other events. Also, please RSVP at the Tinderbox meetup.</p> <p>Every 4 weeks we gather a diverse mix of developers and designers who want to code and collaborate for a couple of hours after work. </p> <p><br/>Bring a project or enthusiasm for working on someone else's. If you want to give a short presentation or run a workshop, we have the facilities and completely welcome ad-hoc organization.</p> <p>We are technology agnostic. However, we're most familiar with and will be the most help with Ruby, JavaScript, and Objective-C (iOS).</p> <p>We kick off with a brief daily-style intro where everyone gives their name, says what they're working on and whether or not they want a hand... then we'll get our hack on. There will be at least a couple Carbon Five folks around to help out.</p> <p>Doors open at 6p, kick-off at 6:30, doors close at 9:45. We provide the infrastructure, food, beverages and some helpful hands.</p> <p>Feel free to run ideas by us if you're thinking about a preso or workshop. It's not required, but it'll help us make sure we have what you need.</p> <p>Find out more at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/tinderbox"><a href="http://www.meetup.com/tinderbox" class="linkified">http://www.meetup.com/tinderbox</a></a>.</p>

V<p>Join us for our usual hack night event plus special guest Jordan Hamel giving a talk on "Beginner\u2019s guide to building a robust mobile app using 3rd party SDKs"</p> <p>Every 4 weeks we gather a diverse mix of developers and designers who want to code and collaborate for a couple of hours after work.</p> <p><br/>Bring a project or enthusiasm for working on someone else's. If you want to give a short presentation or run a workshop, we have the facilities and completely welcome ad-hoc organization.</p> <p>We are technology agnostic. However, we're most familiar with and will be the most help with Ruby, JavaScript, and Objective-C (iOS).</p> <p>We kick off with a brief daily-style intro where everyone gives their name, says what they're working on and whether or not they want a hand... then we'll get our hack on. There will be at least a couple Carbon Five folks around to help out.</p> <p>Doors open at 6p, kick-off at 6:30, doors close at 9:45. We provide the infrastructure, food, beverages and some helpful hands.</p> <p>Feel free to run ideas by us if you're thinking about a preso or workshop. It's not required, but it'll help us make sure we have what you need.</p>

V<p>Startup Finance: Valuation</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/2/event_100045522.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>About:</b> Learn how to value a startup.</p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core. Valuation makes or breaks a company. It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job. This class is a must for all entrepreneurs.

We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company.

V<p>Ok, so this pedi is $35 but it lasts an HOUR, includes a few different scrubs and rubs and is finished off by hot stone. Last time, it lasted FIVE WEEKS. I'm not joking. So, I love this place. I'd schedule the Meet Up sooner but I just got one today, when I reserved the (small) salon for us. Oh, and we can bring some wine if we want :)</p> <p>We have to be prompt because they *usually* get to go home at 7 but will stay until 7:30 for us. I tipped $7 today. I'll probably tip $10 the night of for a total of $45. But, hey, that's still only $9/week if the darn pedi lasts 5 weeks, right?!</p>

V<p>Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.</p> <p>This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.</p> <p>Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?</p> <p>Maptime is hands-on, so don't forget to bring your laptop!</p> <p>We also have plenty of bike parking upstairs, so no need to leave your bike at street level.</p> <p><br/>For more information about Maptime, visit <a href="http://maptime.io">maptime.io</a>. Also, follow us on twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/MaptimeSF">@MaptimeSF</a>.</p>

Good Eggs provides home groceries by aggregating food available directly from local farmers and foodmakers. Lyft provides daily transportation by connecting passengers to people with cars and spare time.</p> <p>Travel accommodation, groceries and transportation are age-old needs. These companies are serving them in new ways with hybrid online/offline services that build on the ubiquity of internet technology to organize complex supply systems into simple-to-use services for their customers.</p> <p>How do you design and deploy a brand across digital and physical experiences? How do you provide a consistent customer experience when much of the product experience is provided by a third party?</p> <p>Join us for a conversation on the challenges, learnings and opportunities in designing for these kinds of services.</p> <p>This event is a panel discussion with leaders in design from AirBnb, Good Eggs and Lyft.</p> <p>Andrew Schapiro, <i>Design Lead, AirBnB</i><br/>Robin Bigio, <i>Creative Director, Good Eggs</i><br/>Frank Yoo, <i>Director of Product Design, Lyft</i></p> <p>Doors open at 6:30pm for great nourishing local snacks and drink from Good Eggs producers.

V<p>Women in the Bay Area - join us on August 6th for our eighth conversation of 2014, with actress Elisa Donovan. This month we'll be talking about Authenticity, and this promises to be a thought-provoking and inspiring conversation. </p> <p><br/>Reserve seats here: <a href="http://www.rosiesdaughters.org/calendar/2014/8/6/a-conversation-about-authenticity-with-elisa-donovan"><a href="http://www.rosiesdaughters.org/calendar/2014/8/6/a-conversation-about-authenticity-with-elisa-donovan" class="linkified">http://www.rosiesdaughters.org/calendar/2014/8/6/a-conversation-about-authenticity-with-elisa-donovan</a></a></p> <p>The proceeds from your ticket, along with some help from our sponsor, cover food and drinks, so come hungry! If you would like to attend but can't afford ticket costs, scholarships are available by emailing [masked].</p> <p>About Elisa Donovan</p> <p>Elisa played the role of feisty fashion-victim Amber in the pop culture Paramount Pictures feature-film Clueless. She went on to reprise her role for three seasons in the follow-up television series. Next, she performed on three seasons of the ABC/WB TV-series Sabrina The Teenage Witch. She has had recurring roles on Beverly Hills 90210, Judging Amy, and Jack &amp; Jill. Among many film roles, she was notably featured alongside Will Ferrell in another comedy classic feature film, A Night at The Roxbury. In 2013, Elisa was voted "Reader/Fan Favorite" by People magazine for her celebrity Mommy blog (<a href="http://celebritybabies.people.com/category/elisa-donovan-blog/" class="linkified">http://celebritybabies.people.com/category/elisa-donovan-blog/</a>). Elisa was also hand-picked by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg to be the voice for the audiobook of her #1 bestseller Lean In and Lean In for Graduates. The audiobook was #1 on the charts for many months and submitted by the publisher for a Grammy nomination. In addition to her acting career, Elisa also assists in counseling and supporting women struggling with eating disorders, and is a proponent of spreading awareness and recovery. She has had pieces published in the Chicken Soup for the Soul series as well as having her anorexia recovery story featured in the book Feeding the Fame and documented for TEEN People. Elisa has spoken about recovery on many television shows, including 20/20, Entertainment Tonight, Access Hollywood, and Dr. Drew's Headline News. </p>

V<p>4v4 pickup (4 simultaneous games if there are enough folks). First session begins at 7pm. Each session is one hour long. Teams are capped at 5 per side to ensure playing time for folks. Substitutions are enforced by the facilitator every 2 minutes so playing time is even spread evenly and everyone can just focus on having fun playing rather than worry about who's going to come out to make room for them. :)</p> <p>The vibe is laid back and fun. Like all SoccerFours sessions, teams are made up at the field, and scores aren't kept. There are no leagues. It's just organized pickup soccer run by a facilitator. $7/person for the session. RSVP here and bring cash to the field or sign up on our main site if you'd like. (If the slots here are full, try our main site to see if there are any left.)</p> <p>Let's have some fun! :)</p>

V<p>It's time for a new meetup for large breeds who like to play and socialize!</p> <p>On Wednesday, 08/06, from 7pm to 8pm, we are hosting a Doggy Meet-Up for those over 45lbs! $12 per dog, refreshments will be provided for the owners! Climate-controlled environment (cold, heat, rain are not a problem for us!) and all the agility equipment will be available for our dogs. We require proof of vaccinations (Rabies, Bordatella and DHPP or titer test results) for all dogs, as we want a safe environment for the pups! </p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/b/e/a/600_251191722.jpeg" /></p> <p>Are you ready for some fun??</p>

She will show you ways to de-stigmatize the word, and help you learn how make atheism a positive thing! </p> <p>She begins her discussion with her journey out of childhood indoctrination and ends with her rise to YouTube stardom, giving straight talk all along the way helping us all learn how to deal with relatives, co-workers or even strangers, despite your possible hesitation or incomplete readiness. She helps us all cope in this society as atheists, and helps some of those on the fence get past their fear. You\u2019ll be glad you came! </p> <p>See more about Jaclyn here: <a href="http://jaclynglenn.com/about/" class="linkified">http://jaclynglenn.com/about/</a></p> <p><br/>Come early to have dinner and drinks, meet Jaclyn, talk with friends and meet new members before Jaclyn's presentation begins at 7:15 PM.</p> <p>As we are helping to pay for her travel and speaking fee, there will be a $10 charge at the door. No Brown Paper Tickets this time, just bring a little cash. Supporting these events will allow us to do even more in the future, so thank you all for that!</p> <p>More media with Jaclyn:</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei_8ZlLGtQw&amp;feature=youtu.be" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei_8ZlLGtQw&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2hZQZ4GwFw&amp;feature=youtu.be" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2hZQZ4GwFw&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

What is "orthogonal unit differentiation" and why is it important? Meaningful choice is one of the staples of good and compelling game design, but as a concept it is still poorly understood. This talk from the Game Developers Conference in 2014 is a detailed exploration of choice in games: why it is important, how it ties into the psychological underpinnings of why we play games, and how it connects to other fundamental game design concepts like the space of possibility, motivation, player agency and the actual level design of a game. Viewers will leave with a deeper appreciation of how games become fun and compelling at a fundamental level.</p> <p><a href="http://schedule.gdconf.com/speaker/worch-matthias.20271">Matthias Worch</a>  | Design Director, 2K Games<br/>Matthias is the design director at a new studio at 2K Games in Novato, where he is overseeing the design effort on an unannounced game. Over the last 16 years, Matthias has worked in design, technical art and project management roles at LucasArts, EA, Factor 5, Legend Entertainment and Ritual Entertainment. Past titles include Star Wars: 1313, Dead Space 2, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron and Unreal 2. <a href="http://www.worch.com/"><a href="http://www.worch.com" class="linkified">http://www.worch.com</a></a></p> <p><b>Location:</b><br/>Dolby Laboratories Inc.<br/>100 Potrero Ave, San Francisco, CA<br/><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=maps+dolby+labs&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ll=37.768773,-122.406514&amp;spn=0.007947,0.009602&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=37.768269,-122.40778"><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=maps+dolby+labs&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ll=37.768773,-122.406514&amp;spn=0.007947,0.009602&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=37.768269,-122.40778" class="linkified">http://maps.google.com/maps?q=maps+dolby+labs&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ll=37.768773,-122.406514&amp;spn=0.007947,0.009602&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=37.768269,-122.40778</a></a> </p> <p><b>That's the brick Dolby building and not the glass one!</b> </p> <p>For information regarding wheelchair access please contact: <a href="mailto:[masked]">[masked].</a></p> <p>-The San Francisco IGDA Organizers-</p> <p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/IGDA-San-Francisco/164045963637622">&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/IGDA_SF"&gt;</a> <br/>The San Francisco IGDA is sponsored by:<br/><a href="http://www.dolby.com/professional/game_development/index.html?WT.mc_id=games_igda1">&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/media-entertainment/games/"&gt;</a></p> <p><img src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/PceFDRzIKqEL5eOC3ZKnYdg_kql3MKvA_q-UHqwKVSwGEoSJs0mrHdQTISgYpZaCA2kOT-pJ4m5cnAciVcaqQ2DLYI3NYnWLOpvTg4JWTYdcPZEx5t3OsvE=s0-d-e1-ft#http://badge.facebook.com/badge/164045963637622.1551.1718495369.pnghttps://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/x5WKGVfXmTyJwNCLpl1z5Qs_kWC4icc8Xmx2N8k2XTaoARDeQERpzsOYQDa2-kpxYjpcSSKIuAy4QLsKYiMUUNYYPekBuj5YsqyMKw=s0-d-e1-ft#http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/follow_us-b.pnghttps://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/zyLwc3LTtlvArKqpU-IRIbsuCYSIN4yYMNxPjKoDsndy-g8A_CNTRZG1ADIm5NJpsdS1bSwdb8guUeEGkw-2=s0-d-e1-ft#http://wilmermurmur.com/igda_sf/Dolby.gifhttps://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/9lA_SVWQeb9-ccu7uEDWSQFr-FymjgUVQuH20aIYLc1-Y9HkzfA05Mb2ERoFG8xk6mWOd1nbcYiqO_UdIXSRrg4OBioQ3URpkg5sYd0=s0-d-e1-ft#http://wilmermurmur.com/igda_sf/ADSK_logo_L_blk_web.png" /></p>

V<p>Let's meet our old friends at the Crossroads Cafe for a nibble and sip after work!<br/>We'll talk about our Photographic New Adventures while looking at each other's work.</p> <p>As this venue is a bit loud, don't expect a "talk" or "speech" or "shoot"; but rather to chat, mingle, review one another work and discuss our photo opportunities.</p> <p><b>Please Note</b>:<br/>This is a Public Meetup - Images brought and shared should be of a public nature!</p> <p>IE: publishable on a Billboard in the US.  Nothing beyond an R Rating should be presented at our group meetings, please.  If you would like to share stronger images, please vet your viewer and do so outside of the SF Photography Meetup Group.<br/>Thanks.</p> <p><b>Our Meetup is NOT intended to be a place for Marketing or Business Promotion, but rather a gathering of like minds to discuss the Art and Technology of photography. Folks are welcome to leave literature or fliers regarding upcoming events or services offered on the sign-up table and answer questions only. Presentations or other sales/marketing should be set up at least one week in advance though the meeting host. This will encourage continued comradery and discourage aggressive marketing at future meetups, ensuring a collaborative environment for all. Thanks.</b></p> <p>Please bring your book(s), your portfolio, pictures or new toy/gadget to share with the group.</p> <p>Bring an image that inspires you...<br/>An image that you really want to make...<br/>Maybe you don't know how, or need someone to go with you to hold a reflector or light.<br/>If you want to know how someone made their awesome photo now's your chance to find out.</p> <p>Don't have a book yet? Bring a Print!<br/>Come be inspired to build a portfolio, see what others have done and learn how you can build your own!</p> <p>Don't have a Print?<br/>Bring and image (magazine or book, printed off the web?) that inspires you - one that you'd want to make!</p> <p>digitalShe's directions to Crossroads Cafe, here:<br/>Cafe in a bookstore at the End of Delancy Street, note, there is generally parking - though now you're gonna pay for it all evening.<br/>Delancy is crossed by Brannan and just off the Embarcadero.</p> <p>From S Bay: Exit 280 at 6th St, follow 6th two blocks and turn right on Brannan St. Keep driving, it's a long ways... Delancy is the last street on the Right from the Embarcadero.</p> <p>From E Bay: Exit @ 5th St and turn LEFT onto 5th. Follow for two bocks and turn Left at Brannan St, follow to Delancy Street and turn Right.</p> <p>Muni: Take the N-Juda or the T/K link.<br/>Exit @ The Embarcadero &amp; Brannan St\u200e Station, walk south toward the AT&amp;T Park and look for a Cafe called "Towns End" in neon... Crossroads is the little grassy gated area directly across from this cafe... look for the small bookstore at the end of the block in the cul-de-sac, that's the cafe!</p> <p>BTW - Be sure to say "Hey, Thanks!" to the staff that let us hang out!<br/>Plan to grab a bite here! Crossroads has light snacks, dinners and deserts along with assorted beverages.  A nice place to relax and mull over this photo stuff with other chill folks...</p>

V<p>The Poisonwood Bible is a story told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it\u2014from garden seeds to Scripture\u2014is calamitously transformed on African soil. What follows is a suspenseful epic of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in postcolonial Africa.</p>

V<p>Last year, the New York Times printed an article entitled \u201cGeneration LGBTQIA\u201d that focused on young gay identity and new terminology trends at colleges and gay community help groups. There seems to be a growing need to be clearer and more specific aboutidentities that have previously clumped under LGBT.</p> <p>According the NY Times reporter, \u201cpart of the solution has been to add more letters, and in recent years the post-post-post-gay-rights banner has gotten significantly longer, some might say unwieldy. The emerging rubric is \u201cL.G.B.T.Q.I.A.,\u201d which stands for different things, depending on whom you ask.\u201d</p> <p>Do you know what all the letters mean? Let\u2019s explore together diverse identities within the gay community. How connected are you to those within our community who are differently gay and how much mutual support do we give and receive?</p> <p>What about coalition building with other communities beyond the rainbow flag?  What commonalities do we have with other communities and what may be some of our differences?  Let\u2019s share our experiencewith living our identity and having it more widely understood and appreciated. Who are our allies and who have we had more difficulty reaching?</p> <p>Discussion Questions:</p> <p>1. What do we all the groups under the rainbow flaghave in common? How are we different?</p> <p>2. How does our life experience differ?</p> <p>3. What relationships do you have with each of the other groups under the rainbow flag?</p> <p>4. What groups do you want to have more knowledge and understanding of?</p> <p>5. How connected are you to those within our community who are differently gay and how much mutual support do we give and receive?</p> <p>6. a. How do you feel about the NY Times reporter\u2019s observation that there seems to be a growing need to be clearer and more specific about identities that have previously clumped under LGBT and the solution has been to add more letters?</p> <p>6. b. According the NY Times reporter, \u201cpart of the solution has been to add more letters, and in recent years the post-post-post-gay-rights banner has gotten significantly longer, some might say unwieldy.</p> <p>7. The LGBTTIQQ acronym- stands for Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Intersexual Queer and Questioning and is meant to be an inclusive term for those who have often been discriminated against and/or marginalized.</p> <p>8. UC Davis LGBTQIA Resource Center defines an ally as \u201c a person who confronts heterosexism, sexism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia and heterosexual privilege in themselves and others out of self-interest and a concern for the well being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and asexual people and believes that dismantling heterosexism, biphobia, transphobia and genderism/cis-sexism is a social justice issue.\u201d</p> <p>Based on this definition, whom do you see asyour allies and whom do you not see as yourallies?</p> <p>9. What about coalition building with other communities beyond the rainbow flag? Shareyour experience with living your identity and having it more widely understood and appreciated. Who are your allies and who haveyou had more difficulty reaching?</p> <p>10. In your opinion, what is needed to gain individuals and groups as allies?</p>

Come ask questions, come show off, but what ever you do, come knit with us</p> <p>We sit inside at Peet's in Saratoga -- we have to move some tables and chairs around to accommodate our large group in their small space.</p> <p>Please note that Peet's does NOT serve dinner -- just delicious coffee, tea, and munchers. Remember it is only right that we patronize the venues that host us. Please buy something from the meetup location!</p> <p>Happy knitting,<br/>-spinnity / mary / organizer</p> <p><br/>*******</p> <p>WHO ARE WE: SCV Knitting Meetup is a loosely organized group of knitters who meet around the valley on Wednesday nights to stitch together. New knitters, new members, knitters of all ages, abilities, and inclinations are welcome.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

We'll be painting the golden gate bridge...check out the details here: <a href="http://www.paintnite.com/pages/events/view/alameda/833291"><a href="http://www.paintnite.com/pages/events/view/alameda/833291" class="linkified">http://www.paintnite.com/pages/events/view/alameda/833291</a></a>.</p> <p>The class is usually $45, but Living Social has a deal for $25 ( <a href="http://www.livingsocial.com/deals/1102169-two-hour-social-painting-event-from-paint-nite?ref=mobile-email-share-post-purchase&amp;rpi=164936914&amp;rui=195604253"><a href="http://www.livingsocial.com/deals/1102169-two-hour-social-painting-event-from-paint-nite?ref=mobile-email-share-post-purchase&amp;rpi=164936914&amp;rui=195604253" class="linkified">http://www.livingsocial.com/deals/1102169-two-hour-social-painting-event-from-paint-nite?ref=mobile-email-share-post-purchase&amp;rpi=164936914&amp;rui=195604253</a></a>). I suggest purchasing your tickets in advance, because the classes usually sell out.</p> <p>They have pretty good prices for food &amp; drinks. Come early if you want to eat or get a drink before the class starts. I'll probably get there at about 6:00.</p> <p>I can't wait!</p>

She will show you ways to de-stigmatize the word, and help you learn how make atheism a positive thing! </p> <p>She begins her discussion with her journey out of childhood indoctrination and ends with her rise to YouTube stardom, giving straight talk all along the way helping us all learn how to deal with relatives, co-workers or even strangers, despite your possible hesitation or incomplete readiness. She helps us all cope in this society as atheists, and helps some of those on the fence get past their fear. You\u2019ll be glad you came! </p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aSee more about Jaclyn here: <a href="http://jaclynglenn.com/about/" class="linkified">http://jaclynglenn.com/about/</a> </p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aCome early to have dinner and drinks, meet Jaclyn, talk with friends and meet new members before Jaclyn's presentation begins at 7:15 PM.</p> <p>As we are helping to pay for her travel and speaking fee, there will be a $10 charge at the door. No Brown Paper Tickets this time, just bring a little cash.

V<p>4v4 pickup (4 simultaneous games if there are enough folks). Second session begins at 8pm. Each session is one hour long. Teams are capped at 5 per side to ensure playing time for folks. Substitutions are enforced by the facilitator every 2 minutes so playing time is even spread evenly and everyone can just focus on having fun playing rather than worry about who's going to come out to make room for them. :)</p> <p>The vibe is laid back and fun. Like all SoccerFours sessions, teams are made up at the field, and scores aren't kept. There are no leagues. It's just organized pickup soccer run by a facilitator. $6/person for the session. RSVP here and bring cash to the field or sign up on our main site if you'd like. (If the slots here are full, try our main site to see if there are any left.)</p> <p>Let's have some fun! :)</p>

V<p> </p> <p>The Silicon Valley Entrepreneurs Toastmasters Club welcomes all entrepreneurs, engineers, professionals and students to join the meetings. Please join us if you want to enhance your professional leadership effectiveness and improve your public speaking and communication skills.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>11:45 pm: Open for Registration<br/>11:50 pm: Networking<br/>12:00 pm: Toastmasters Meeting<br/>1:00   pm: Adjourn</p> <p><i><b>Every last Thursday of the month, we have a "pitch training session" specially designed for entrepreneurs and startup founders.</b></i></p> <p><i><b><br/></b></i></p> <p><b>Why Should You Join Toastmasters?</b></p> <p>Everyone has their own personal reasons for joining Toastmasters, but here are a few of the most common:</p> <p><b>Become a Better Public Speaker</b><br/>Members work through a series of educational programs (at their own pace) designed to improve their ability to write speeches, design presentations, and deliver them.</p> <p><b>Overcome Public Speaking Fears</b><br/>The most positive and supportive audience in the world is a Toastmasters club audience. Speaking regularly in front of a group helps you calm your nerves and communicate effectively.</p> <p><b>\u201cPractice\u201d Presentations for Other Audiences</b><br/>Everyone has different motivations for wanting to speak better. Maybe you want to hone your presentation skills for your career. Perhaps you want to be able to speak out in your volunteer organization. Maybe you want to complement your portfolio as an author, manager, or other professional with speaking gigs? Whatever the case, Toastmasters is a wonderful laboratory for you to practice your presentations and gain valuable feedback.</p> <p><b>Gain the Confidence and Courage to Lead</b><br/>Leadership and communication skills are intimately bound. Some might argue that leadership is nothing more than the ability to effectively communicate a vision. As your communication skills improve, your ability to lead will improve as well.</p> <p><b>???</b><br/>Many Six Minutes readers are Toastmasters, so I\u2019ll pass this question to you.<br/><b>Why did you join?<br/>What advice would you pass to someone considering joining?<br/></b> Let us know in the comments.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

V<p>Join us for an AFTERNOON of HANDS ON CREATIVITY, ENGINEERING, and IMAGINATION! BOYS and GIRLS are invited to come create with ROOMINATE! Have your little one LEARN as they PLAY!</p> <p>On Thurs. 8/7 from 3-6 pm, drop by anytime! We invite your child and you to come and CREATE with ROOMINATE.</p> <p>ROOMINATE is hosting this wonderful playdate and we want to invite you and the whole family to come on out and learn through hands on play. Let's show you how it all works!</p> <p>Through hands on play, we'll have stations with modular building pieces so they can build whatever their heart desires, a station to build furniture to add to their structures, another station where they will learn about motors, lights and circuits so they can make their structure come to LIFE while learning about the engineering that is involved and another station for them to decorate their creation.</p> <p> Intro Talk and Welcome Chat will take place every hour at 3:15 pm, 4:15 pm, 5:15 pm.</p> <p>Come build a structure, with stairs, a balcony, and even spiral staircases! Then design furniture, from bunk beds, ping pong tables and more! Then the best part about ROOMINATE is adding the working circuits, by wiring up everything from spinning windmills, to merry-go-rounds, even elevators and more to make it light up! We will also share a bit of history &amp; how parts get made, with a station called "Roominate through the ages!"</p> <p>There's a bunch of old prototypes so kids can see the process of making pieces and how it started from laser cutting to injection molding. EVENT COST: FREE! If your Child enjoys the product and so do you, ROOMINATE'S kits will be available for purchase on site so that your child can continue to develop their creativity and engineering savvy at HOME!</p> <p>Want to purchase so your child can continue to create, learn and build?</p> <p>Basic Roominate kit $30*</p> <p>2 for $55</p> <p>Deluxe Roominate kit $50*</p> <p>2 for $90 Free $15 value of additional pieces with every purchase</p> <p>*Same price as on Amazon</p> <p>WHAT is ROOMINATE? WHAT is the PRODUCT ALL ABOUT?</p> <p>Roominate, toys to inspire the next generation of innovation. Roominate is a wired building system for children that inspires creative learning and empowers innovative open-ended play. It develops skills crucial to future success in STEM: hands-on problem solving, spatial and fine motor skills, self-confidence, and creativity.</p> <p><br/>Roominate is an innovative combination of building, circuits, design, and creativity that allows for endless creations. Roominate kits come with modular building pieces and motor and light circuits that kids can wire up to create spinning windmills, carousels, and lamps! With Roominate, kids can build anything they can imagine: dollhouses, schools, amusement parks, and more.</p> <p>Roominate teaches through hands-on play. Every kit is completely open-ended, which encourages girls to learn by doing. Every child makes something completely unique with Roominate, from the golden gate bridge, to spinning car washes, even a rocket ship!</p> <p>With Roominate, every child is an inventor. You can see the breadth of ideas here: <a href="http://www.roominatetoy.com/young-inventors/" class="linkified">http://www.roominatetoy.com/young-inventors/</a></p> <p>Kids love Roominate because they can build anything they want. Parents and teachers love Roominate because they know that kids are learning as they play. It\u2019s completely open-ended and kids are coming up with things we never would have dreamed of!</p> <p>Website: roominatetoy.com Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/roominatetoy" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/user/roominatetoy</a></p>

V<p>Have questions about Chef? Are you doing some cool stuff with Chef and what to share it with others chefs? Come to <a href="http://www.redrockcoffee.org/">Red Rock Coffee</a> in Mountain View and meet me, Rob and other Bay Area Chef users. We will meet on the first and third Thursday of the month between 5pm - 7pm. Look for an Opscode Chef sticker (most of the time we will be at the 2nd floor, but I will post an update if we can't find enough space).</p> <p>Note: This is an informal meeting (that's why we meet at a cafe) and we welcome everyone regardless of your experience with chef. If you have questions this is a great place to ask them and establish the connections with people that can help you in the future. There is no presentation on these chef cafe meetings, and if you want to share something in a more formal way please let us know and we will schedule a separate meetup for that.</p>

V<p>Confirmed RSVPs have priority.</p> <p>Come and play tennis at Fremont High School!</p> <p><b>Players of all levels are welcome</b>, especially 3+ players. Play is courteous, self-organized, with orientation from the organizer, to keep games/skills more or less even and maximize the fun. You are expected to follow the lead of the organizer when pairing up players or waiting, if it comes to that. We can play singles or doubles depending on the availability of courts.</p> <p><b>We expect all people that RSVP to attend.</b> We ask that you <b>change your RSVP by 2pm if you cannot attend the event</b>. No-shows will probably lead to not being allowed to participate in future events.</p> <p>Please try to be there on time. If you are early, try getting courts (starting on the leftmost court is best). Attendees to the meetup are expected to bring their own balls. Fresh balls for play are encouraged.</p> <p>The meetup goes on until everyone is depleted, often after 9 or 9:30pm.</p> <p><b>Waitlist:</b> What do you do if you are in the waitlist? You should <b>definitely plan to attend</b> the event, but <b>45 to 60 minutes from the start</b>. At that time, things start to ease and spots open up. We ask that you <b>always wait outside</b>, at the entrance, until the next re-shuffle of partners or a court opens up. In the rare event that there are a lot of people waiting due to lack of courts, confirmed RSVPs have priority, but even then we will try to shuffle everyone in.</p> <p><br/><b>Parking:</b> The courts and parking are on the West Fremont Ave. entrance (about a block in from the Sunnyvale-Saratoga road), inside, after 9 rows of parking spots.</p> <p>This is a sister event to the "Tuesday Tennis in Sunnyvale" meetup.</p>

V<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasgorski">Nick Gorski</a> will be joining us to give a talk about the Data Science involved in personalized marketing.  Note this talk will be held at <a href="http://www.tellapart.com/">TellApart</a>, which is in Burlingame (right next to Burlingame Caltrain).  I hope to see many of you there!</p> <p><b>Abstract</b><br/>This will be a technical deep-dive into TellApart's personalized marketing solutions: the machine learning data pipeline that powers the models, real-time calculations of the expected value of shoppers, and how to translate that value into a bid price for every bid request (and we receive hundreds of thousands per second). This is the first time that we've pulled back the curtain and detailed TellApart's secret sauce!</p> <p><b>Speaker</b><br/>Nick Gorski is a software engineer at TellApart, where he applies data mining and machine learning to build personalized marketing products. Over the past three years at TellApart, his work has spanned platform development building the machine learning data pipeline to product development using predictions to deliver targeted shopping experiences. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Michigan.</p> <p><br/><b>Schedule</b> <br/>6:30 - 7:00pm Social (food + beer served) <br/>7:00 - 8:30pm Talk <br/>8:30 - 9:00pm Social</p>

V<p>Hey Everyone,</p> <p>Our regular meeting is coming up this Thursday!</p> <p>We meet twice a month on the first and third Thursdays, and each meeting consists of a mixture of Japanese and English.  We run our meetings in both languages so you can follow along in your native tongue.  This is also a great way to enhance your skills in your non native language.  Guests are always welcome.</p> <p>No reservation is required, but we'd appreciate it if you could let us know you'll be coming so we can welcome you to our meeting/club.  Please contact us in advance at <a href="mailto:[masked]">[masked]</a>.  Please visit our website for more information <a href="http://www.svjets.org">www.svjets.org</a>.  We recommend that you arrive at 6;50PM, since the front door auto locks at 7:00PM sharp.</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you soon!</p> <p>Michael Sera<br/>President SVJETS</p>

V<p>New Location. This month we will meet at Cory Nott's offices in Concord. It's near the airport. It's easy bicycle distance from BART.</p> <p>Cory will provide beer for this meeting, and we can chip in for pizza. Please indicate any preference you might have ahead of time.</p> <p>There is plenty of room for a big group.</p> <p>Join the Contra Costa Libertarians to share your opinions on today's political climate and issues and learn how you can contribute to America's political future. Everyone interested in Libertarianism is welcome! The business portion of the meeting starts at 7:30. If you'd like to come just for the socializing, that usually starts at 8pm. There's no charge, but you'll make your own arrangement for food and drink. Non-libertarians are welcome but you should have a healthy interest in politics.</p>

V<p>The San Francisco Singer-Songwriters' Workshop's purpose is to give you an opportunity to receive constructive critique so you can improve your songs and performances. </p> <p>Please bring in a song to perform and include copies of lyric sheets if you want them critiqued (a good rule of thumb is check the RSVPs and bring half as many). Singers wanting performance critique are also welcome. </p> <p>A piano, acoustic guitar, and P.A. system are provided. Accompanist not provided.</p> <p>The meetup requires an initial charge of $20 for new attendees and then $10 per meetup for returning members. There's no way in the payment section to specify this so it shall be stated here in the details. The money goes to cover the cost of the meetup group, rental of the Union hall, PA, and refreshments.</p>

V<p>I somehow missed reading this book as a child, but it seems appropriate and the movie comes out August 15th and looks pretty well done.</p> <p>Plot Summary: The story centers on twelve-year-old Jonas, who lives in a seemingly ideal world. Not until he is given his life assignment as the Receiver does he begin to understand the dark secrets behind his fragile community.</p> <p>Movie Trailer: <a href="http://youtu.be/oYZxZups06w" class="embedded">http://youtu.be/oYZxZups06w</a></p> <p>We can also schedule another Meetup to watch the movie together.</p>

It's a moderate hike up, and worth it for the great views of the Livermore Valley and Altamont windmills.</p> <p>The hike is just short of 2 hours. Be sure to bring plenty of water. <i>Keep in mind it can get a little windy out there, so you might want to bring a light jacket if it's a cool evening. </i></p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/c/5/4/600_380107252.jpeg" /></p>

V<p>"Geoffrey Firmin, a former British consul, has come to Quauhnahuac, Mexico. His debilitating malaise is drinking, an activity that has overshadowed his life. On the most fateful day of the consul's life, his wife Yvonne arrives in Quauhnahuac, inspired by a vision of life together away from Mexico and the circumstances that have driven their relationship to the brink of collapse. She is determined to rescue Firmin and their failing marriage, but her mission is further complicated by the presence of Hugh, the consul's half brother, and Jacques, a childhood friend. The events of this one significant day unfold against an unforgettable backdrop of a Mexico at once magical and diabolical.</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/9/e/600_312745502.jpeg" /></p> <p><i>Under the Volcano</i> remains one of literature's most powerful and lyrical statements on the human condition, and a brilliant portrayal of one man's constant struggle against the elemental forces that threaten to destroy him."</p>

V<p>Come unleash your Karaoke Animation Domination by joining us for a THEME NIGHT devoted specially to songs from  animated films and cartoons.  I'm talking about those awesome tunes from your favorite  <b>Disney</b> (Little Mermaid, Lion King, Frozen, etc.) <b>Pixar</b> (Toy Story, Cars, Brave, etc.) or <b>Dreamworks</b> (Shrek, Madagascar, Prince of Egypt, etc.) flicks.  We also welcome songs from any cartoon shows (e.g. Family Guy, Scooby Doo, Flintstones, etc).</p> <p>You can find some great resources online for these songs:</p> <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M74FDTBEZ4w"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M74FDTBEZ4w" class="embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M74FDTBEZ4w</a></a> </p> <p><br/><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/azafar/the-definitive-ranking-of-the-102-best-animated-disney-songs"><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/azafar/the-definitive-ranking-of-the-102-best" class="linkified">http://www.buzzfeed.com/azafar/the-definitive-ranking-of-the-102-best</a></a></p> <p>Our fun begins at the Bamboo Lounge at the Wyndham Hotel  (This not to be confused with the 7 Bamboo Bar which we previously visited in Japantown.)  The Bamboo Lounge is located at the Wyndham Hotel in San Jose on Fourth Street, not far from the SJ Airport, and just down the road from the 4th Street Bowl.</p> <p><br/>The Bamboo Lounge is quite posh and comfortable with Bamboo trimmings all around. There is plenty of parking at the hotel. Our member DJ Mike Westerman will be doing the show here and he has a GREAT song selection.  They also have a great dinner menu if you wish to dine and sing.</p> <p>Karaoke starts at 9:00 p.m., but <b>we'll be meeting at 8:30 pm</b> to save seats and sign up early.</p> <p>Hope to see you there.</p>

We welcome anyone to attend a GoRampUp! meeting, once, for free as our guest, so you can learn what the innovative GoRampUp! business-networking experience is all about. Note, we are not able to give you a free meeting at more than one of our many locations.</p> <p>YOU MUST obtain a free-access GoRampUp! Golden ticket by registering for a specific meeting at<a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar/"><a href="http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/" class="linkified">http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/</a></a>. This ticket must be presented at your complimentary meeting for you to gain admittance. Without this ticket you will, unfortunately, be declined access to our innovative and exclusive business-networking meeting. WITH a GoRampUp! Golden Ticket, you will be welcomed with open arms!</p> <p>It can be too difficult to attract new clients. We help you fix that! We're a business-impact community. We're informal and fun, yet, by design, we're extremely effective!</p> <p>We help people who work for a living to get a much greater payoff from working. We do this in three specific ways under our three CoreSuccess Platforms: 1) We help you move toward mastery with business-networking, 2) We help you move toward mastery with business performance, and, 3) We help you move toward mastery with personal development.</p> <p>How do we deliver on this promise to our community members? Each month we conduct dozens of business-networking meetings in more than a dozen cities in the SF Bay Area. A member may attend all of our "OpenConnect" business-networking meetings. And our members are welcome and encouraged to attend any and all of these meetings and locations.</p> <p>Each month we introduce and emphasize a learning and development subject under each of our three CoreSuccess Platforms. For each of the three learning and development subjects that we introduce and emphasize each month, we give you four different ways to learn it: We produce written learning guides, video learning guides, audio learning guide, and we cover the subjects as 15-to-20-minute mini-workshops inside of our 60-minute business-networking meetings. There's no registration or initiation fee to join. Membership in GoRampUp! is month to month. You enroll when you like, even mid-month, and you depart when you like.</p> <p>Be sure to see our website to learn about <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/growrampup">our generous enrollment incentives</a></p> <p>Also, be sure to learn about our <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/norisk">100-Satisfaction Money-Back Guarantee</a></p> <p>Would you care to come to this meeting, at no cost, to see if there\u2019s business-value for you?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">Free-Meeting Guest-RSVP and Golden Ticket Request</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">View complete meeting details</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/invite">Invite a Buddy to join you</a></p> <p>One last thing: You REALLY should check out actual testimonial videos by our members: <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/why">See them here</a></p> <p>This page was created to produce awareness of our event.

V<p>Levi's Stadium -- the new home of the San Francisco 49ers -- opens for tours on August 8, so join us for this private group tour and be one of the first to see the completed stadium. We'll start the event with a visit to the onsite 49ers museum where we will see the five Super Bowl trophies!</p> <p><br/><b>Schedule</b><b><br/>4pm:</b> Meet at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/yI2OA">Levi's Stadium</a> outside the 49ers museum entrance<br/><b>4:15pm:</b> Enter 49ers museum<br/><b>5:10pm:</b> Regroup at Intel Gate A (located at the northwest corner of the stadium)<br/><b>5:30pm:</b> Guided stadium tour begins<br/><b>7pm:</b> Guided stadium tour ends</p> <p>I had to prepay for this 20-person group tour.

Now is the time to get an insider\u2019s look at the state-of-the-art venue. Learn how the stadium created the ultimate fan experience through innovation and technology. From the playing field to the rooftop, understand how the building is the smartest and greenest in all of the NFL and be surprised as you walk the interiors viewing the amazing custom art collection featured throughout the building.

From there you\u2019ll move to the Morabito Theater to watch the 49ers signature film and then into the Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. 49ers Hall of Fame where you\u2019ll walk amongst the 49ers greats. Our Heritage Gallery innovatively illuminates the history of the team through artifacts and multimedia exhibits and leads perfectly into the active In the Game gallery on the lower level.

V<p>It's our monthly bowling night! Second Friday of each month. All skill levels are welcome. We're there for fun and friendship.</p> <p>Our start time has changed. <b>Now starting at 5:00</b> to take advantage of the half price rate and better availability of lanes.</p> <p><b>We'll will be there just before 5:00</b> to get the half price deal (2.00 per game, plus shoe rental). If work gets in your way, just come when you can. We'll probably be there till at least 6:30.</p> <p><b>Please show up if you rsvp.</b> Even though this is for fun, we need an accurate headcount so we know how many lanes to secure. Those lanes MUST be purchased as a group, BEFORE 5:00 to get the 2.00 a game discount. Don't be a flake and a no show.</p> <p>Food and beverages available.</p> <p>See you at the lanes!</p> <p> </p>

Same thing if you want a guided ride on Sunday. We figured, once we get one guided ride, then we'll be able to plan our own ride for the next day. </p> <p><b>Guided rides descriptions</b>: Optional.  You do not have to go on a guided or any ride to camp with us.  Both on Saturday.   Bring LOTS of water and food on the rides.  (Please don't show up at a ride start unprepared and then become a burden to your ride companions.  It can ruin a ride.  Been there; done that.) Required: Helmet, tools, tube.</p> <p><br/>\u2022 <b>Advanced</b>: 4 hours, 20-25 miles, fast pace (8 mph avg), short regroups.  Should have the skills to ride over some tricky bits but nothing death defying. </p> <p><br/>\u2022 <b>Intermediate</b>: 4 hours, 15-20 miles, moderate pace (6 mph avg.), short regroups, time allowed to walk over obstacles. </p> <p><br/><b>Reservations</b> for rides + camping or camping only: Choose one of the "Hubbard Party" links. <a href="https://squareup.com/market/mendocino-bike-sprite-llc"><a href="https://squareup.com/market/mendocino-bike-sprite-llc" class="linkified">https://squareup.com/market/mendocino-bike-sprite-llc</a></a></p> <p><b>Schedule</b>: Can arrive anytime on <b>Friday</b> starting at 5:00 p.m.  Alex and I will arrive around 8:00 p.m.  <b>Saturday</b>:  morning: guided rides leave by 9:00 a.m.  Anyone not going on a guided ride can do whatever they want.  Enjoy!  Afternoon/evening: nothing planned but sloth.  We'll be hanging out at camp, snoozing, drinking beer and eating.  Please join us.  <b>Sunday</b>: non guided intermediate ride will leave by 9:00 a.m. You're welcome to organize a ride of a different level or do your own thing.  We'll be heading home sometime 3:00 - 5:00.  You can stay as long as you want.  Leave too early and you hit Marin County traffic. </p> <p><b>Trails description</b>: Have ridden on only a few of the trails in this area but here's what I saw: twisty, mostly smooth dirt, some slick areas covered in pine needles, not a lot of rock/gravel or technical stuff.  Some logs.  A little bit of mud.  Heavily forested, lots of brush.  Some poison oak, prickly berry vines and stinging nettles.  I wear knee socks.</p> <p><b>Esprit de corps</b>:  we're quiet, early to bed/early to rise kinda folks.  If you're not, you may not want to hang with us.  We respect the natural environment and leave nothing but tire prints/take nothing but memories.  We don't use soap in or near streams/ponds.</p> <p>State Parks is taking a chance on us, let's show'm mountain bikers are desirable tourists.</p> <p><br/>See you there!  Winona</p>

A fireside chat is when there are more than two people engaged in a discussion. Another way to describe a fireside chat is like a one on one meeting on steroids! What a great way to manage your time by getting to "DEEPLY" know several great professionals at once!!!</p> <p>Please join us every second Friday of the month to expand your resources, allow us to help further your power partnerships, and even possibly help you find your next clients!</p> <p>Food and drinks will be available for purchase.</p> <p>For your convenience, The Beverly Heritage Hotel will provide a no host bar and a special food menu.

We also welcome any wonderful and like-minded business professionals from anywhere in Northern California. We are willing to help these people outside of our immediate area in the same way as if you were here in our local San Francisco Bay Area communities. What makes us truly genuine is that we have no hidden agendas. We are here to sincerely help you from the heart!</p> <p>The Genuine Networking Association was created to provide San Francisco Bay Area Business Professionals with an affordable alternative to meeting other like-minded business professionals. FREE NETWORKING!!! :-) We understand during these trying times that not everyone can afford to spend a lot of money on networking. Also, while we are not discouraging other groups, we feel that you don't need to spend a lot of money or waste your time at other events, that are not going to be the most productive use of your time and financial investment.</p> <p>Genuine Networking Association website link:</p> <p><a href="http://www.genuinenetworkingassociation.com"><a href="http://www.genuinenetworkingassociation.com" class="linkified">http://www.genuinenetworkingassociation.com</a></a></p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/5/f/8/event_88298392.jpeg" /></p>

V<p>August 8 \u2022 </p> <p><br/>Michael Jackson Tribute</p> <p><br/><a href="http://www.foreverlandsf.com/">Foreverland</a></p> <p><br/>media sponsors: </p> <p><a href="http://www.kblx.com/">KBLX,</a></p> <p> </p> <p><a href="http://www.koit.com/">KOIT</a></p> <p> &amp; </p> <p><a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/">NBC Bay Area</a></p> <p> </p> <p><br/>Foreverland is a 14-piece tribute to one of the most amazing entertainers in the world, Mr. Michael Jackson. Based in San Francisco, the group was formed in March of 2009 to honor Michael's musical genius and legendary showmanship. With four lead vocalists, four horns and a six-piece rhythm section, the ensemble is best described as a "Remarkable and Rocking Michael Jackson Revue." Rather than be limited by a MJ impersonator and pre-recorded backing tracks, the band's unique approach is to celebrate the larger than life performances, imagination and infectious spirit of this legendary artist.  The result is a fabulous and thumping 14-piece show band that pays homage to MJ's undeniable talent and timeless dance music. As the band likes to say, "Don't Blame It On The Sunshine, Don't Blame It On The Moonlight, Don't Blame It On The Good Times, BLAME IT ON THE BOOGIE!</p>

V<p>Souk Savanh is one of the authentic Lao restaurants that lie within the "Little Saigon" area of Oakland (with International Blvd x East 12th St as its epicenter). Little Laos bleeds a little more into Fruitvale.</p> <p>Souk has greater scale than Sticky Rice Cafe, is more polished than Vien Tian Cafe with its earthier flavors, and is not to be confused with the fusion offerings of the more popular Champa Garden. You won't find "Laos Tacos" here. Instead, you'll find the most extensive menu of purely Laotian offerings, in an airy comfortable setting.</p> <p>Dinner will be banquet style, with a fixed menu. </p> <p>If you are interested in carpooling (as opposed to car pooling), make a comment.</p> <p>Diners should cancel 48 hours in advance to allow vacancies to be filled.</p> <p>This event is cross-posted to another dining group, for a total of 10 diners. This may affect precedence of RSVP.</p> <p><br/>Thank you,</p> <p>Stephen Yeh / Lebeauviolet</p>

V<p>** This is an OPEN gaming event series. We are listed on the GameKastle calendar, so this event will serve both to generate interest in our meetup group, and to get us gaming with players of all genders. **</p> <p>Every 2nd Friday of the month, join us at GameKastle Santa Clara to mingle with local gamers, both male and female. We'll reserve a table or two for ourselves to set up open games, and for me to field any questions about the Geek Girls from visitors.</p> <p>If you'd rather join an existing gaming table at GameKastle, the Geek Girls will be there to back you up! Maybe you'd feel more comfortable joining that Warmachine table, or that Pathfinder adventure, or that Friday Night Magic draft if you aren't the only girl at the table. Maybe you just want a group of familiar faces to come back to after you score that big win, or suffer a tough defeat.</p> <p>Since this is a mixed gender event, feel free to bring male guests too! I will officially stay until around 9:30pm at the latest, but you may choose to come earlier and/or leave later as you wish.</p>

V<p>Paranormal Investigation for members only (no guests allowed and no one under the age of 18)</p> <p>Cost - $55.00 per person (payable at time of RSVP)</p> <p>This location has never been investigated before. We will have 6 hours to investigate 2 floors, a basement and attic. The house was built in 1876 and is approximately 7,000 Sq. ft. including the attic and basement.  </p> <p>We will be separated into 2 groups of 6. Please do not wear any perfume, cologne or scented lotions - as it makes it hard to determine phantom smells. Please feel free to bring any equipment except for Ouija boards and headlamp style flashlights. You can bring food and drinks that can be left in the back room, which will be our setup area. There is a refrigerator and microwave available.</p> <p><b>Some History</b>:</p> <p>This is the very first location where I got an awesome picture of a giant orb during a daytime tour. It was back in May 2011. The photo is posted under that event, so check it out if you have time.</p> <p>There have been several deaths in the house. Most of them just because people back in that time period died at home. There was one tragic death at the house, a young girl (I believe a niece of the family) who was not allowed to attend a party given in the garden. She went up to the attic and was leaning out of the window watching the party and fell to her death. Another family member drowned, at the age of 82, while taking his daily swim in the nearby creek.</p> <p>All of the family members that were buried on the property were relocated due to the creek flooding. They were moved to Mountain View cemetery in Oakland.</p> <p>The following are just two places where you can find some history and information.</p> <p><a href="http://nileshomesweethome.blogspot.com/2010/05/niles-shinn-nurseries.html"><a href="http://nileshomesweethome.blogspot.com/2010/05/niles-shinn-nurseries.html" class="linkified">http://nileshomesweethome.blogspot.com/2010/05/niles-shinn-nurseries.html</a></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2010-07-13/article/35838"><a href="http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2010-07-13/article/35838" class="linkified">http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2010-07-13/article/35838</a></a></p>

V<p>The ecstatic experience of expression through drumming and vocalization is magnified when we learn how to harmonize with others.  We'll explore a practical methodology for learning the archetypes of rhythm and how they can be used in combination with other players-of-music to help strengthen and heal not only our own energy, but those that are in vicinity of its influence.  </p> <p>Bring a drum if you have one; bring two if you have one to share.  Bells are also highly recommended because they're much easier to use than a drum.</p> <p>The time-tested polyrhythmic aesthetic and approach to music is cross-cultural, and along with your devotion and correct practice attracts wellness and augments any practice of stillness.   This session will not be a 'thunder-drum jam,' but more a guided lesson.</p> <p>I encourage you to bring a recorder to help learn.</p>

V<p>Okay everybody, we can totally do this! The route of the Livermore Half Marathon winds 13 miles from Downtown Livermore, through Sycamore Grove and into the beautiful vineyard covered hills of Livermore.</p> <p>We'll be starting early to beat the heat and doing just under 13 miles total. <i>We are not starting at the official half marathon starting point, instead, we'll meet at the corner of 6th and South K.</i></p> <p>We'll break it up with breakfast at the Wente Grille ... which is delicious btw! </p> <p><b>Be sure to bring LOTS of water</b> (we can refill at the halfway point/Wente) <i>and bring cash for your breakfast at the Wente Grille (they won't split the check). </i></p> <p><i>Note: Don't let the word Marathon scare you ... there is no running or speed-walking allowed on our leisurely half-marathon walk. :)</i></p> <p>Check out the basic route below. This is from the official runliv site, so ignore the notations of water stations ... those won't be there. </p> <p>Please join us! The more the merrier :)</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/2/2/4/600_380116932.jpeg" /></p> <p>The map is a little hard to read at this size, so here\u2019s the basic route:</p> <p>Start at 6th and South K</p> <p>South on So. L St/Arroyo Rd.</p> <p>West on Concannon Blvd.</p> <p>South on Holmes</p> <p>Brief turn onto Wetmore and then into Sycamore Grove to Wente Grille</p> <p>BREAKFAST :)</p> <p>North on Arroyo and then into Holdener\u2019s Park</p> <p>Turn on Marina Ave and then connect with the Arroyo bike trail that runs beside the Arroyo Mocho Creek.</p> <p>Back to 6th &amp; South K</p>

V<p>Details TBA</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aTrail Running 101</p> <p><br/>You got questions, we got answers.</p> <p>Trail Running Shoes- there is a BIG difference between road running sneakers and trail running sneakers. Trail running shoes have much more traction, a close knit upper to keep dirt and water out, and often have a rock plate to protect your foot from the trail. The ease of running trails is increased dramatically by having this type of shoe in your closet. You can get by on most trails with road shoes, but if you think you will be spending a lot of time on the trails it may be worth it to invest in something that will give you some more control over the ground.</p> <p>Time- Run a 9:00/mile on the road? Be ready to add 1-2 minutes per mile more than your road running when you get on the trails. There are hills, obstacles, and terrain to deal with out there. Don't worry about walking up big hills and running down the other side, that's what the best trail runners do! A good rule of thumb is, if you can't see the top of it, maybe you should walk it. Of course we aren't talking about a leisurely walk here, a power hike can do wonders to get you up that hill without too much fatigue on the legs. When you get to the top, don't completely open up and tear down the hill either. Chances are there is going to be another giant hill you are going to have to climb up and you don't want to kill your legs.</p> <p>Maps- It's easy to run to run on the bike path without getting into too much trouble, but trails are a bit trickier. Often there are maps provided at the park you may be going to, but it is also a good idea to print out a map ahead of time. In regards to our Trail Meetup, there is ALWAYS a map linked in the Meetup description. Do yourself the favor to take some time to look at the route and what trails you might get confused at. Print it out and bring it with you, along with the turn by turns. If you have any questions about the directions, email Meghan! The second piece of maps is the ELEVATION map. Check this out! See where the hills are, how big the hills are, and where you think you might struggle. Not all trail runs have the elevation maps attached, mainly because the trails aren't routed on Google maps yet. The ones that are, definitely take a look!</p> <p>Water and Food- Hand in hand with the Time and Maps category, is nutrition. PLEASE bring along at LEAST 8 ounces of water to each trail run. Remember you might be out there for 2 hours for an 8 miler. Make sure you are aware of that and prepare accordingly. Bring your water, bring your food. Always overprepare. It might happen that you take a wrong turn and that 5 mile loop you were running has suddenly turned into 12 miles. This has happened to the best of us, and we don't want you to be unprepared for that situation.</p> <p>Scenery- The places we are going to be running are beautiful, no question about it. However. Keep your eyes on the ground! You may totally see that gigantic root and graciously leap over it with no problem, but the next step there is going to be a tiny little rock you totally over looked, and then you will be meeting the dirt. Be vigilant, keep an eye out where you are going.</p> <p>Weather- It may be 65 and sunny in San Jose, but in the mountains it is significantly colder, especially under tree cover, bring extra layers. If you get to the park and realize it isn't that cold, you can always leave the layers in the car, but it's always better to be safe than sorry. I've seen frost on some local trails when it's been 70 in San Jose. Jackets, gloves, ear warmers, long sleeve shirts.</p> <p>RESPECT- Finally, and most importantly, RESPECT the park you are in. Whatever you bring in, bring out. Don't litter, don't destroy plants, don't go off the marked trail, and don't cut across switch backs. That mountain has been there way before any of us, and let's make sure it will be there after we are gone. With respecting your environment, remember you are in NATURE! This means things like poison oak, animals, etc. If you see deer, don't chase them or yell at them. If you see any baby animal, give it a wide berth. Mama is close by and you don't want to make her angry. Most importantly (and I have to cover this), mountain lions and bobcats. Chances are, you are NOT going to see one of these animals. However, if you do, make yourself appear as large as possible. Raise your arms, open your jacket, be tall. Second, make noise. yell, shout, bang a stick against a tree. DO NOT make a sound that could be confused as the sound of prey. Speak loudly, firmly, and slowly. Third, act like a predator yourself. Maintain eye contact. Never run past or away from a mountain lion. Don't bend down or crouch. Never turn away. Finally, slowly create distance. Back slowly to a spot that gives the mountain lion a path to get away.</p> <p>Finally, you are going to see other people enjoying the park, just like you. Be courteous and respectful. If you want to pass someone, yell ON YOUR LEFT with enough time to allow the person to react and move.</p>

V<p>Join SCVAS bird expert Bob Reiling to enjoy the bird life at this elephant seal habitat area.  Plan on a 3-4 mile walk mostly on sand.  We hope to spot and identify a variety of birds including the Marbled Murrelet.  We expect to see early returnees from their summer in the north.  Bring a hat, lunch, liquids and dress in layers.  Prepare for fog, wind, and bright sun.  Bring birding scopes if you have one and cameras if photography is your interest.  There is a $10 par car parking fee.</p>

V<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-bundle-joomla-migration-8914-and-joomla-templates-91314-tickets-11954509259">Register for this workshop on Eventbrite.</a></p> <p><br/><b>Migration time!</b></p> <p>Joomla 2.5 is scheduled for end-of-life on December 31, 2014. This means we need to migrate Joomla 2.5 sites to Joomla 3 by then (or at least that's the perfect world scenario).</p> <p>In this workshop, we will work with our site at joomlabayarea.com as an example site to migrate from Joomla 2.5 to Joomla 3. We want to go over many more migration examples as well. Attendees can have a development copy of one of their 2.5 sites set up and we can help guide through those migrations too. We won't have time to do super huge sites - so pick a reasonable site with a few third-party extensions and an off-the-shelf template. This is not a prerequisite and you don't have to have a site to migrate for participation in this workshop.</p> <p>Lunch will be provided along with drinks. All of this is included with the cost. We will not have food in the morning, only coffee and water, so grab something before you arrive. Or there is a cafe in the Museum where you can grab a bite.</p> <p><b>Tentative Schedule for this workshop:</b></p> <p><b>9:00-9:30 Registration and Setup</b></p> <p><b>9:30-10:00 Arrive, coffee, get settled</b></p> <p><b>10:30-11:00 Announcements, Joomla Roadmap discussion:</b><br/>This segment will be announcements, discussion about the points of the Joomla Roadmap as it pertains to migrations and the technical specifications for Joomla 3 to lead into the next segment.</p> <p><b>11:00-11:30 Planning and Migration Process Outline:</b><br/>Planning can easily take more than a half hour. In this segment we will go over questions to ask yourself as you plan for migration and what the two processes to migrate from 2.5 to 3 are. This includes technical specifications for Joomla 3, hosting, content and how it relates to responsive design, how to prep the 2.5 site, redesigns, clean-up, goals, and more.</p> <p><b>11:30-12:00 Templates:</b><br/>This segment will address templates and how to handle them for migration from 2.5 to 3. We will only be discussing off-the-shelf third-party templates. We will not be discussing custom templates at this workshop. Learn the things to look for when changing templates and setting the expectation with the client.</p> <p><b>12:00-1:30 Lunch</b><br/>We will have a catered lunch and then explore the incredible Computer History Museum. The museum is a fun, informative and inspiring place to be! You will have time to see the things that interest you most, or just stroll through and see the exhibits at your own pace.</p> <p><b>1:30-2:15 Third-party extensions:</b><br/>Third-party extensions have numerous ways they need to be migrated. Learn the three main processes that most third-party extensions fall into for migration and how to handle them. We will be looking at several extensions to see what to do about them during this segment (for joomlabayarea.com and for the attendee sites).</p> <p>15 minute break</p> <p><b>2:30-4:30 Migrations and troubleshooting:</b><br/>This is the segment that we do the migrations. No matter how many white screens we get, we will go through it and work with it. If time permits, we'll get to some system clean up after the migrations.</p> <p>We will be meeting in the Boole Room at the Computer History Museum.</p> <p>Parking is easy and free in the Computer History Museum Parking lot. We will send attendees more info about parking prior to the event. Do you or someone you know need financial help to attend this workshop? We will have some scholarships available. <a href="mailto:[masked]">Email our support staff</a> to request a scholarship and why you want to attend the workshop and a few details about your situation. Wanna bring a client? <a href="mailto:[masked]">Talk to us</a> about having them attend too.</p> <p>Includes a ticket to check out the Computer History Museum day of!!</p> <p>Migration is just part of life in Joomla. Come to this workshop to have a better life. lol!</p> <p>This workshop costs $50. It is bundled with the Template Workshop in September. You may attend one or attend both. Attend both and save $20 by buying the Bundled ticket. If you want to attend both, pick either date from the ticket area and we will have you covered. No need to bring a paper ticket to either event.</p> <p>Directory Members receive an additional 10% off. Promo code sent separately.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/workshop-bundle-joomla-migration-8914-and-joomla-templates-91314-tickets-11954509259">Register at Eventbrite.</a></p>

V<p>Technically, this is not a part of the Bay Trail but it is a really fun tour. As some of you know, I used to work at Alcatraz. I've got lots of good stories. They also offer great walking tours by really knowledgeable people to help you get the most out of your tour and possible behind the scenes access.  Tickets are booking 90 days out so we need some lead time to plan.  Ticket sales are not yet available this far in advance.  I will send out reminders around May 1st to purchase tickets or earlier if they become available.</p> <p>Make sure to sign up for the 10:00 a.m. departure.  The boat leaves promptly at 10:00 a.m. so be sure to find us in the boarding area as early as possible.</p> <p>There is a cafe next to the Pier that has drinks and deli foods.  It opens at 8 a.m.    I recommend bringing a lunch as lines can be long and the food is expensive.   Coffee or tea can be purchased on the island. </p> <p>Visitors can take any boat back to the Pier.  We will probably be on the island for about 3 hours at least, including lunch.</p> <p>This is an expensive trip - tickets to get to Alcatraz are $38 and parking will probably cost $15 but the good news is that the Pier where the boat departs for the island is easily accessible by Public Transportation.</p> <p><a href="http://www.alcatrazislandtickets.com/Alcatraz-Tickets/"><a href="http://www.alcatrazislandtickets.com/Alcatraz-Tickets/" class="linkified">http://www.alcatrazislandtickets.com/Alcatraz-Tickets/</a></a></p>

We meet on the 2nd Saturday of every month for a casually paced social group ride at one of the many great parks in the area. This is a 'no-drop' group ride (we won't leave you behind or let you get lost).</p> <p>Rides generally last 2 to 3 hours and are great opportunities to meet other East Bay mountain bikers at your skill level and to discover the best trails without having to do it on your own.</p> <p>Rides are free and open to the public and led by experienced local mountain bikers familiar with the trails.</p> <p><b>Groups for ALL skill levels!</b></p> <p><b>Skill Building Beginner Group (C):</b> The group starts off slow, and tapers back from there!<br/><b>Relaxed Intermediate Group (B):</b> We stop to regroup and enjoy the view once in a while.<br/><b>Fast Paced/Advanced Group (A):</b> You'll get a chance to catch your breath, every now and then.</p> <p>We start gathering at 9:00am and hit the trails promptly at 9:30am. Join us for refreshments and snacks after the ride.</p> <p>Please note: As we are currently in the winter riding season, inclement weather can result in the Gala being postponed. As such, BTCEB will confirm via email the status of the ride by 5pm Friday before the Gala.</p>

V<p>Many of you missed this one in May, and others said, "Let's do it again", so we're heading back to Angel Island for more merriment, food, fun and sun.</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/c/2/event_348534722.jpeg" /></p> <p>PLEASE NOTE:  Either meet at the Tiburon ferry at 9:45 or on the island at the picnic area to the right of the dock, past the open field w/ the museum.  The hike starts at approx 10:45</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/b/8/0/event_348536192.jpeg" /></p> <p>The Plan:</p> <p>We'll hike around the perimeter of the island (about 5 miles) almost entirely flat other than the initial rise to the perimeter trail.  Not a rough hike by any means, and of course the rating is contingent upon your condition. There are great views of the bay and bridges, so bring your cameras!  This is typically the most popular event of the year, so book your room now!</p> <p>We'll leave the coolers/food at the picnic area and only hike w/ some snacks and vino.</p> <p>The hike is optional, so if you want to come chill while we hike and then eat, drink, and be merry w/ the rest of us after the hike - do it!</p> <p>It would be nice to have a few people stay w/ the coolers/food while we hike.</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/7/4/event_348535412.jpeg" /></p> <p>We'll leave the food and most of the vino at the picnic area, then hike around the island, bringing just snacks and some vino to enjoy on our vino/snack break along the trail.  There's a cool spot on the backside of the island w/ picnic tables and a great view of the Bay and the City, where we'll stop for refreshment(s).</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/9/9/6/event_348535702.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/6/e/a/600_371690922.jpeg" /></p> <p>What to bring:</p> <p>Vino (and cups)</p> <p>Snacks and vino for the hike.</p> <p>Your appetite!</p> <p>A cooler w/ ice and plenty of food</p> <p>Food to BBQ (someone please bring a small gas stove - Thx Ed for bring one in May)</p> <p>Sandwiches, wraps, bbq, paella, chicken, meats/cheeses/breads, salads, deserts, the works!  As always I'm hoping for plenty of ethnic food.  Not just boring hamburgers and hot dogs.  We're talking variety here, and lots of spicy food!</p> <p>Plenty of Vino - we had some really nice bottles last time</p> <p>Beer, water, soda, juice, whatever you want to whet your whistle</p> <p>Chips, dips, snacks, and plenty to share</p> <p>Layered clothing, sunscreen &amp; hat</p> <p>Hiking boots, or decent hiking shoes</p> <p>$5 activity fee</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/b/2/event_348534962.jpeg" /></p> <p>Of course your sense of humour and desire for fun is an absolute must!</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/9/e/event_348534942.jpeg" /></p> <p>The hike is optional, so if you want to come chill while we hike and then eat, drink, and be merry w/ the rest of us after the hike - do it! </p> <p>It's always nice to have a few people stay w/ the coolers/food while we hike.  And yes, you get some vino while we're away!</p> <p>Directions to ferry:</p> <p>From US 101 heading Northbound Take the Tiburon Blvd exit, turn right, and follow Tiburon Blvd 4 miles into downtown Tiburon.

V<p><b><i>You know how to play Jericho, now see if you can beat a team of people who had an hour to prepare!</i></b></p> <p><b>The Chronos Missions</b> is a semi-persistent, team-based Jericho game that lasts one day for 5.5 hours.</p> <p><br/>Your team will know several days ahead of time when your missions are scheduled, but you won't know details about what &amp; where (other than somewhere in SF) until the hour before.</p> <p><br/>You will be on call for two missions on the day you registered for.  Each of the one hour missions will be run as early as 10am or as late as 3:30pm. All briefings will be made via email to each team one hour before Mission Start.</p> <p>You can assemble a team ( 4 agents, including you!) or be assigned to one. Simply put down how many guests you want to bring.</p> <p><br/>You will need a smart phone, Nerf gun, bandanna, and Ninja-like infiltration &amp; evasion skills!</p> <p>Space is limited to 4 teams , so grab 3 friends &amp;  come on out!</p> <p>Lots more details to follow after RSVP.</p> <p>"As always, should you or any of your I.M. Force be caught or killed..."</p> <p>---The Chief</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aPS---The only reason this was cancelled back in April was that we didn't get email addresses &amp; photos of all the players. If that sounds too difficult for you, you should probably skip this one.</p>

Parking is free and the grounds are open to the public exept on the days they have special events. (July 12 is clear of special events.)</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP2rgkk8Ci8" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP2rgkk8Ci8</a></p> <p>You can download a guide to Montalvo with a map of all trails (PDF Document) at <a href="http://media.montalvoarts.org/uploads/documents/2014/June/Montalvo%20Map_small929.pdf" class="linkified">http://media.montalvoarts.org/uploads/documents/2014/June/Montalvo%20Map_small929.pdf</a></p> <p>We'll first condition ourselves by walking in the gardens and grounds, then hike up the trail.  From the beginning walk to the hike, we'll go for about 45 minutes, and head back, to make the entire hike about 1 hour and 30 minutes. </p> <p>\u2022 These trails have more elevation gains than our usual flat trails.

V<p>We'll meet at the picnic tables between the bathrooms and the rock playground near the basketball court</p> <p>If you've been struggling with your dogs house manners, walking on the leash, or aggression problems, or if you'd just like a more responsive, obedient dog, come on out and work with us.  Chances are, a few lessons on how to properly handle your dog will clear most of these problems up, resulting in a much more fulfilling relationship for you and your dog.</p> <p><br/>This course will be $35 to attend all 8 weeks of training.</p> <p><br/>This dog training program focuses on building a relationship with your dog based on love, respect, and clear communication.  We use rewards and gentle corrections to teach your dog the language you will use to communicate with them going forward.  Most dog problems are caused by a lack of love, respect, or clear communication, either by dog or handler.  This course will fix that for you.  By attending this 8 week program and doing all the homework, you should be able to expect your dog to "auto sit" anytime you come to a stop while he's walking with you on leash.  You should also be able to expect your dog to sit, down, on command, "auto-stay", and recall.  We'll also talk about leash/collar equipment, crates and crate training, and manners. </p> <p><br/>It's not so much dog training, as it is human training for your dog.  It teaches you how to handle and communicate with your dog so that you become the leader in the relationship, instead of allowing your dog to train you ;)</p> <p>We'll meet at the picnic tables between the bathrooms and the rock playground near the basketball court.  If you have trouble finding me, you can call me at 40eight- 4three9-4nine38.</p> <p>Required Equipment:</p> <p>- Water for both you and your dog</p> <p>- A collar that fits properly (Flat nylon or leather, training collar [aka: "choke chain"], or a pinch collar.  If you're using a pinch collar, please make sure you also have another type of collar on your dog to be used as a back up.</p> <p>- 6 foot leash</p> <p>- 15 foot leash (3rd week)</p> <p>- 30 foot (or longer) long line (5th week)</p> <p><br/>- Comfortable footwear (flip flops are not recommended)</p> <p><br/>- Good attitude</p> <p>- Lots and lots of patience</p> <p>Optional Equipment:</p> <p>- Treats for your dog</p> <p>- Folding chair</p> <p>- Sunscreen</p> <p>Rules:</p> <p>- Always keep your dog on leash and under control at all times!</p> <p><br/>- Please do not approach someone else's dog, or more importantly allow your dog to approach someone else's dog with out talking to that dog handler and ensuring it's ok first, and only when the dog's handler/owner is aware you are approaching.  No sneak attacks!</p> <p><br/>- Always clean up after yourself and your dog.  Even if you think no one saw your dog defecate behind the tree, it is your duty to clean up after your dog.</p> <p><br/>- Fun and joking around is an important aspect of our training, but  within reason.  Please treat your dog, and the trainer(s), and other class members with respect.</p> <p>- If any inhumane treatment or abuse to your dog is witnessed, you will be asked to leave the class.</p> <p>- Find time to do your home work.</p> <p><br/>Things you must know:</p> <p>- Understand I use people and dogs as an example throughout the class -- Good and bad.  Everyone gets to participate in this, so please do not feel picked on. </p> <p><br/>- There will be moments of fast paced walking or jogging.  If you have injuries or ailments which preclude you from this type of activity, don't do it.  Just step aside and allow the others to go b and I will bring the group back to you.  This is completely fine.  Don't worry about doing anything you don't feel comfortable doing.</p> <p>- If you get tired or frustrated, feel free to take a break.  We can talk after class if you have any concerns.</p> <p>- If you do not do the home work every week, you cannot expect to see noticeable results in your dogs behavior, but if you do the home work every week, by the end of the class you should see noticeable results that will make you much happier to have your dog around.</p> <p>- If you think your dog is aggressive, or may be two aggressive for a group class, please contact me to schedule an evaluation of your dog.</p> <p>- Week 1 starts off kind of rough and can be very frustrating for you.  Please be patient and remember this is a course that has helped hundreds of people learn to effectively handle the dog.  If you're patient with yourself and your dog, and you do the homework, you're going to do great!</p> <p><br/>We will have no class on 8/23,  or 9/20.  Those classes will be held on 9/27 and 10/4/14.</p>

V<p>For the fourth straight year, the Geek Club is going to the beach in Santa Cruz!</p> <p>Every year, we have journeyed to Santa Cruz where we enjoy the Seabright Beach and the Boardwalk. The first of us will arrive early to claim a nice spot on the beach. We'll eat a potluck lunch (don't count on a grill, though) and play in the sand. Groups will take turns going over to the boardwalk, while others stay with our stuff. Come when you want, and stay as long as you want!</p> <p>Please bring a food item or beverage to share. List what you are bringing so others can coordinate. Since we'll be spending all day on the beach, please consider bringing more substantial food items rather than snacks. Also, sunscreen and clothing layers are a must!</p> <p>Dogs are permitted on Seabright Beach as long as they are on a leash.</p> <p>Also -- If anyone can bring a canopy, it would be awesome. Please let us know if you can.</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a<b>CARPOOLING:</b></p> <p>We highly recommend carpooling. Gas is not cheap. Parking is scarce. The road is long and windy. Also, it is fun to carpool and get to know each other better. We just have to make sure we have space to haul everything as well.</p> <p>In years past, we have met in groups in the south parking lot for Vallco Shopping Mall in Cupertino (near Steven's Creek Blvd.) It's a convenient location close to 280 and 85 (which leads to 17, and in turn Santa Cruz.)</p> <p>As we all have different schedules for both coming and going, I'm going to just leave it to all of you to work out the carpooling in the comments.</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<b>USEFUL LINKS:</b></p> <p><a href="http://www.thatsmypark.org/cp-parks-beaches/seabright-state-beach/">Info about Seabright Beach</a></p> <p><br/><a href="http://www.beachboardwalk.com">Info about the Beach Boardwalk</a></p> <p><br/><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/10123+N+Wolfe+Rd/@37.3303346,-122.0156378,15z/data=!3m1!5s0x808fb59f3545de4b:0x8d1e17b96310b305!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x808fb59f52a20377:0x41391c800333d171!2sVallco+Fashion+Park!3m1!1s0x808fb5989e5820fd:0xbf29db3278eb798c">Directions to Vallco Shopping Mall</a></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<b>WHAT PEOPLE ARE BRINGING:</b></p> <p>Please leave what you are bringing in the comments.

V<p>Startup Finance: Valuation</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/2/event_100045522.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>About:</b> Learn how to value a startup.</p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core. Valuation makes or breaks a company. It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job.

Ice chests on the deck for your drinks, feel free to bring whatever you want to drink, but have a DDriver if you have more than two.</p> <p>I'll post a list of dishes needed closer to the date!

V<p>This trip is finally happening! This will be a beginner-friendly trip to the Marin hostel in Rodeo beach. It\u2019s a short, paved trip, and we won\u2019t carry much weight, hence why this is a great introduction to touring.<br/>The main aim of this trip is to visit the Point Bonita lighthouse on their sunset tour, though you can feel free to skip that.</p> <p><b>Bike routes</b><br/>Saturday:<br/>We\u2019ll leave from Embarcadero at 1pm. The road to the hostel is all paved. There is a climb, and it starts out mean, but it gentles off soon enough. We\u2019ll stop at all the batteries to do some exploring (and catch our breath) so bring a lock if you\u2019re concerned. You\u2019re also welcome to go on ahead (or start later and meet us on the way, we should be a pretty obvious bunch). Map here: <a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/449176316">Embarcadero to Marin hostel</a>, 12mi, 1200ft ascent.</p> <p>Sunday:<br/>I\u2019ll probably go back through fire roads + ferry, because that\u2019s fun and we won\u2019t carry much load. This (<a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/449177380">Hostel to ferry on dirt</a>, 12mi, 1140ft ascent) looks a likely route. This alternative route (<a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/449177988">Hostel to ferry paved</a>, 5mi, 500ft ascent) is all paved and the easiest way back.<br/>There are plenty of options for ferries (schedule <a href="http://goldengateferry.org/schedules/Sausalito.php">here</a> and <a href="http://www.blueandgoldfleet.com/ferry-services/ferry-schedules/">here</a>) but you can also ride back to SF fairly trivially.</p> <p>I\u2019ll bring copies of maps for everyone. I expect to be back in SF early afternoon, so I won\u2019t plan for lunch, only a big breakfast + snacks.</p> <p><br/><b>Rodeo beach Marin hostel</b><br/>We have booked two rooms of 5 (one double and 3 twins in each). The first 10 to rsvp who want to stay in those rooms will get a spot. The rest should book themselves in (you can cancel up to a certain date without incurring any fees). The group rooms will most likely be co-ed, so if you don\u2019t want that, you can choose gender-specific dorms when you book individually. Whether you\u2019re in the rooms of 5 or not, it\u2019ll end up being around $30 a night. There is a bicyclist discount we should mention at check-in (which is when we actually pay).<br/>Hostel FAQs <a href="http://www.norcalhostels.org/marin/hostel-faqs">here</a>.</p> <p>PEOPLE IN GROUP ROOMS SO FAR - FULL (cos 2 double beds):<br/>Jean + Magnus - double<br/>Ellie<br/>Lincoln<br/>Kuro Kurosaka<br/>Kevin<br/>Sacha<br/>Sandy<br/>Daphne C</p> <p>\u000a\u000aPEOPLE ON WAITING LIST FOR GROUP ROOM (might want to book a dorm bed and cancel it if you get into the group rooms):<br/>Greeshma</p> <p>\u000a\u000aPEOPLE WITH THEIR OWN SLEEPING ARRANGEMENT:<br/>Robert Huang<br/>Lee T + 1<br/>Jane<br/>J Scott Matthews<br/>Akiyo<br/>Dan<br/>Scott<br/>Ryan LaBarre</p> <p>\u000a\u000aIf you were inclined to camp, there is free camping at Bicentennial (close to the lighthouse) or at Hawk camp (a few miles up a dirt road away from the lighthouse/hostel). You do have to book those and they get popular.</p> <p><b>Point Bonita lighthouse sunset tour</b><br/>We\u2019ve got room for 17 people to come on the free, docent guided sunset tour of Point Bonita Lighthouse (see <a href="http://www.weekendsherpa.com/stories/point-bonita-lighthouse-full-moon-tour/">weekend sherpa</a> and <a href="http://www.sunset.com/travel/california/experience-point-bonita-lighthouse-after-dark">Sunset magazine</a> for mild spoilers).<br/>You can still join the trip if you don\u2019t want to do the tour, or if you\u2019re at this point in time not on the first 17. I\u2019ll keep the rsvp updated in order so any cancellation will move down the list.<br/>Those coming on the tour will need to have eaten and be ready to go at 7pm from the hostel. The tour starts at 730pm and finishes at 9pm. We\u2019ll be riding there and back (in the dark).</p> <p>PEOPLE WHO HAVE A SPOT ON THE TOUR - FULL FOR NOW:<br/>Jean<br/>Magnus<br/>Ellie<br/>Lincoln<br/>Robert Huang<br/>Ryan LaBarre<br/>Lee T + 1<br/>Kuro Kurosaka<br/>Kevin<br/>Sacha<br/>Dan<br/>Jane<br/>J Scott Matthews<br/>Akiyo<br/>Scott<br/>Daphne C</p> <p>\u000a\u000aPEOPLE WAITING FOR A SPOT ON THE TOUR:<br/>Greeshma</p> <p><br/>PEOPLE SKIPPING THE TOUR:<br/>Sandy</p> <p>Since this is not happening for a while, I wouldn't be surprised if there were some cancellations, so don't let the full tour deter you - I'll be going through the waitlist in order!</p> <p><br/><b>What to pack</b><br/>Food for dinner and breakfast, any snacks<br/>Pjs, clothes for two days, toiletries<br/>Layers for evening tour - heat layer (fleece or down jacket), windproof layer<br/>Bike lock (we will leave bikes behind during the tour)<br/>Bike lights (blinky at the very least) and headlight - we will be riding back from the tour in the dark on a quiet, open-to-car-traffic road<br/>Comfy shoes to walk in (1h30 tour standing)</p> <p>The hostel provides bedsheets and towels, and has a full kitchen.</p> <p><br/>This is a trip where you could get away with a backpack if you haven\u2019t got a rack/pannier setup yet. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019d be super comfortable but it should be manageable due to the short distances.</p> <p>I'm limiting the group size to 25, but really there's no limit. It's 17 max going on the lighthouse tour, and 10 max in our group rooms, but you can book yourselves into the hostel if the trip is full and come on the ride either way.</p> <p><br/>If you have any questions, feel free to message me!</p> <p><i>********************************************************</i></p> <p><i>Important Notice: The Organizer, Assistant Organizers, and Event Organizers in this group are not professional leaders or guides.

V<p>Startup Finance: Valuation</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/2/event_100045522.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>About:</b> Learn how to value a startup.</p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core. Valuation makes or breaks a company. It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job.

V<p>Hear ye, hear ye....</p> <p>Calling all ladies for a ladies-only lunch and tea outing. If you love the femininity and genteelness of a bygone era. If you are really into period movies, sigh [and maybe also salivate :) ] at the sight of 1700s and 1800s ballgowns, hats, gloves and parasols, love Mr. Darcy, and would jump at the chance to get in a time machine to travel back in time to those periods, then join us for lunch and tea at Lisa's Tea Treasures, at the Pruneyard.</p> <p>Their food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. Here is the link so that you can check out the menu: <a href="http://www.lisastea.com/menu.aspx" class="linkified">http://www.lisastea.com/menu.aspx</a> .</p> <p>In case you are wondering why the attendee limit is 4 in this group, it's because I have scheduled this outing in two of my groups - this one and another one, for a total of 8 spots. I have limited it to 8 total in order to avoid the complication that comes once the reservation goes past that number. With a larger group, they require a credit card when the reservation is made, pre-ordering, they prefer everyone to order the same item - and if a person does not show up, they still charge the full price of the dish.</p> <p>Well, now that you know the full scoop, sign up to join us for a grand ol' time. If you would like to wear a lovely hat, pearls, lace, or whatever other "lady-like" item of your choice, feel free to do so, but it is not required. I will probably wear a hat. :)</p>

V<p>Let's hike some of the secret stairs near the Oakland/Berkeley border. We will meet near the Highwire Coffee Roasters section out on the sidewalk. You may wish to arrive early to Rockridge Market hall to sample the cheeses and pick up a lunch or use the restroom.   At 1:40 sharp we will start the hike.  Phone help is not available for latecomers and those not ready to leave at 1:40 pm.</p> <p>Our hike will take us to the areas surrounding the Claremont hotel.  We will do 1 or 2 of the walks from the book called Secret Stairs East Bay and possibly the  Claremont Canyon preserve if time permits.  There will be hills, views, paths, stairs and some areas of steepness. We will take a short lunch/snack break.</p> <p>The walk will end in the Ashby area where we will have a long happy hour in a backyard not too far from the Ashby BART station.   For those who have attended our backyard happy hours in the past, note that this is the last party at Shannon's wonderful backyard before she moves away.  We will make a stop at the Berkeley Bowl to buy food and drink.</p> <p>Please note that the the hike will end in the Ashby area and not back at Rockridge.  Attnding the happy hpour is optional.  We will take a short lunch/snack break.</p> <p>Safety Disclaimer: The organizers of this meet-up are unpaid volunteers and not expert hiking guides.

V<p>Come enjoy good company and music at the fabulous, 66 person capacity, Treasure Isle Cabana!</p> <p>Bring whatever food and drink you like. There are plenty of stores and restaurants nearby if you wish to pick something up on the way.</p> <p>Get your band together and belt out a song or two on the mic karaoke style, shred on the plastic guitars, hammer on the keys, or beat on the drums. If you need help rounding out your band or learning the Rock Band ropes there will be plenty of roadies on hand. Don't be shy.</p> <p>If being a rock star is not your thing try your hand at tabletop games. Bring your favorite to play and share or sit in on something that looks interesting. Should be plenty of room to lay out even the most complicated board games.</p>

V<p>The <a href="http://www.LPSF.org">Libertarian Party of San Francisco</a> holds our regular monthly meetings on the <b>2nd Saturday each month, from 3-5pm</b>, followed by a dinner social from 5-6pm. Currently we are meeting at the <b>San Francisco Main Library</b>, at Grove and Market (see <a href="http://mapq.st/h/1-AF9HopC4"><a href="http://mapq.st/h/1-AF" class="linkified">http://mapq.st/h/1-AF</a>...</a> for map), in the <b>4th floor community meeting room</b>. Occasionally another group will be using this room, in which case we will be in a community meeting room on the 1st floor. Everyone is welcome to come and be part of the discussion, however in order to vote on party business you must be <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_vr.htm">registered to vote as a Libertarian</a> if eligible, and become an LP member by completing a <a href="http://www.lpsf.org/documents/LPSF_Membership.pdf">membership form</a>. Sometimes our meetings include a guest speaker. After the meetings, those of us who want to hang out and chat over a meal head over to Ananda Fuara vegetarian restaurant at Market and Larkin streets for our social. You're welcome to come for just the social, just the meeting, or both. You can always check meeting details, or find out the latest LPSF news and happenings, on our <a href="http://www.LPSF.org">Libertarian Party of San Francisco website</a> (LPSF.org). Thanks for your commitment to freedom, and on behalf of our local chair Aubrey Freedman and the rest of our group,  we look forward to meeting you! -Starchild, LPSF Outreach Director and Meetup Group organizer</p>

Yet often we\u2019re not sure how to:</p> <p>\u2022 Find potential partners and begin the dating process</p> <p>\u2022 Manage the vulnerability, fears and triggers that can come up</p> <p>\u2022 Assess true compatibility (and gracefully say No to incompatible people)</p> <p>\u2022 Pace the relationship appropriately (no more 2nd date U-Hauls!)</p> <p>\u2022 Determine the right timing for getting physical</p> <p>\u2022 Get clear on our relationship vision \u2013 rather than just \u201cgoing along\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Create a relationship better than any we\u2019ve had before.</p> <p>We\u2019ve developed Conscious Connections to help!</p> <p><b>How Does Conscious Connections Work?</b></p> <p>At each Conscious Connections event, we eliminate the awkwardness, and give you ways to briefly connect one-on-one with 10 or more women present \u2013 so you can learn about them in authentic ways, while also learning more about yourself.</p> <p>One by one, we\u201dll present ten 5-minute laser lessons about how to build intimacy, heal conflict, and create long-lasting, happy love. After each lesson, you\u2019ll have five minutes to talk about the lesson with a different partner. (So, you\u2019ll have ten 5-minute conversations in all.) We\u2019ll end with a mixer during which you can reconnect with your conversation partners to exchange contact info \u2014 and/or connect with the other women present.</p> <p><b>Lively. Fun. Compassionate. Thought-provoking. Friendly. Welcoming. Real.</b></p> <p><i><b>A great new way to get to know other women \u2013 and learn tools for a great relationship, too!</b></i></p> <p>You can RSVP here, but to make sure a spot gets held for you (since we only have room for 50 women!), please pre-pay the $25 fee at <a href="http://www.consciousgirlfriend.com/conscious-connections">www.consciousgirlfriend.com/conscious-connections</a></p>

Let's get a group together and see the game!</p> <p>We could tailgate before the game and bring the BBQs for our own Jucy Lucys, Jello Salad and Old Dutch and wash it all down with some Grain Belts before we head into the game.</p> <p>Game time is 6:05pm. The suggestion is to each buy our own ticket(s) for the bleachers - seating is first come, first served out there - but that's where the cool kids sit and it's a great experience.</p> <p>Tickets are $15</p> <p>You can buy them here: <a href="http://purchase.tickets.com/buy/MLBEventInfo?agency=MLB&amp;pid=7635115&amp;tfl=Oakland_Athletics-Schedule-2014_Promotional_Schedule-na-a0" class="linkified">http://purchase.tickets.com/buy/MLBEventInfo?agency=MLB&amp;pid=7635115&amp;tfl=Oakland_Athletics-Schedule-2014_Promotional_Schedule-na-a0</a></p> <p>Also, for the baseball fans, that day will be Tony LaRusa Bobblehead day in honor of his Hall of Fame induction. If anyone wants a bobblehead, they might want to get to the stadium by 4pm - the line gets long and supplies are limited.</p> <p>Someone will be in the parking lot for the tailgate starting around 3:00pm. P.S. Tailgate will be potluck, so bring your finest Jell-O Salad or traveler hotdish, or CheddarWursts.</p> <p>P.P.S. We'll post the specific location for the tailgate on the day of the game.</p>

V<p>Lathe machines are powerful and versatile, however, not everyone can afford to have one at home. We will show you how to make a basic DIY lathe turner from tools found in the home, and demonstrate how to use it. It's serious, so bring your eye protection (however, we will NOT be blowing things up at this event)! This lathe will be able to turn plastics and wood into useful projects; legs, pens, poles, decorations, supports, rocket bodies, pea shooters, or whatever turns your fancy! Everyone is welcome.<br/>In typical hacker fashion, we are having our demo al fresca - at the lovely Memorial Park, around sunset!</p>

V<p>Join us for a practice session at VoiceOne Studio in San Francisco. I will provide scripts from ads or work currently on TV, radio and the internet and we will record you reading them. We'll listen and offer constructive criticism to each other. Then we'll listen to the original finished product and see how ours differ. Bring your skills, creativity and sense of fun! Sessions are $15 for members payable at the class. I look forward to seeing you there!</p>

V<p>Progressive Talk is a monthly meetup to discuss the important political and social issues of the day. This two-hour meeting combines dinner with stimulating conversation, covering topics suggested by both the Organizer and club members.</p> <p>If you would like to suggest a topic, please post it in the comments section below, with a link to a related webpage (such as a news article) that people can review before attending. The Organizer will also announce topics in the same manner. To ensure that everyone has a chance to review the upcoming discussion topics, please post your suggestions at least three days before the meeting.</p> <p>The first hour of the meeting will center on topics suggested by the Organizer, while the second hour will focus on topics suggested by members. If there are many topics suggested by members, a quick informal vote will take place during the meeting to decide the topics for the second hour.</p> <p>If you love good food and conversation about current affairs, please join us for a fun evening of progressive talk. Hope to see you there!</p>

V<p>Synopsis: Sex. Danger. Jealousy. More Sex....the "Beast with two Backs"... suffice it to say you will probably want to bring wine for the picnic before this outdoor performance of Othello!</p> <p>Even among Shakespeare's "greatest hits," Othello has a special place. Few works are this sexy, this dangerous, this relevant to the passions and evils of the modern world. Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army, and his new wife, Desdemona, seemingly have it all -- true love, success and happiness. But can anyone protect them from "honest" Iago, a master magician of deceit?</p> <p>The inspiration for villains as varied as Milton's Satan and Breaking Bad's Walter White, Iago is one of the most hypnotically evil characters ever created. Witness Shakespeare's profound tragedy about the power of love and jealousy as performed by the Shady Shakespeare Theatre Company. Details &amp; $10 Tickets: <a href="http://www.goldstar.com/events/saratoga-ca/othello?gtmEcf" class="linkified">http://www.goldstar.com/events/saratoga-ca/othello?gtmEcf</a></p> <p>PICNIC BEFORE PLAY at 5:30. Sanborn Park is a lovely place for a picnic at dusk! Surrounded by Redwoods with lots of grassy areas and picnic tables. As always, bring food to share and the beverage of your choice. Hopefully that beverage will be wine :)</p>

V<p>Many of you missed this one in May, and others said, "Let's do it again", so we're heading back to Angel Island for more merriment, food, fun and sun.</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/c/2/event_348534722.jpeg" /></p> <p>PLEASE NOTE:  Either meet at the Tiburon ferry at 9:45 or on the island at the picnic area to the right of the dock, past the open field w/ the museum.  The hike starts at approx 10:45</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/b/8/0/event_348536192.jpeg" /></p> <p>The Plan:</p> <p>We'll hike around the perimeter of the island (about 5 miles) almost entirely flat other than the initial rise to the perimeter trail.  Not a rough hike by any means, and of course the rating is contingent upon your condition. There are great views of the bay and bridges, so bring your cameras!  This is typically the most popular event of the year, so book your room now!</p> <p>We'll leave the coolers/food at the picnic area and only hike w/ some snacks and vino.</p> <p>The hike is optional, so if you want to come chill while we hike and then eat, drink, and be merry w/ the rest of us after the hike - do it!</p> <p>It would be nice to have a few people stay w/ the coolers/food while we hike.</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/7/4/event_348535412.jpeg" /></p> <p>We'll leave the food and most of the vino at the picnic area, then hike around the island, bringing just snacks and some vino to enjoy on our vino/snack break along the trail.  There's a cool spot on the backside of the island w/ picnic tables and a great view of the Bay and the City, where we'll stop for refreshment(s).</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/9/9/6/event_348535702.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/6/e/a/600_371690922.jpeg" /></p> <p>What to bring:</p> <p>Vino (and cups)</p> <p>Snacks and vino for the hike.</p> <p>Your appetite!</p> <p>A cooler w/ ice and plenty of food</p> <p>Food to BBQ (someone please bring a small gas stove - Thx Ed for bring one in May)</p> <p>Sandwiches, wraps, bbq, paella, chicken, meats/cheeses/breads, salads, deserts, the works!  As always I'm hoping for plenty of ethnic food.  Not just boring hamburgers and hot dogs.  We're talking variety here, and lots of spicy food!</p> <p>Plenty of Vino - we had some really nice bottles last time</p> <p>Beer, water, soda, juice, whatever you want to whet your whistle</p> <p>Chips, dips, snacks, and plenty to share</p> <p>Layered clothing, sunscreen &amp; hat</p> <p>Hiking boots, or decent hiking shoes</p> <p>$5 activity fee</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/b/2/event_348534962.jpeg" /></p> <p>Of course your sense of humour and desire for fun is an absolute must!</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/9/e/event_348534942.jpeg" /></p> <p>The hike is optional, so if you want to come chill while we hike and then eat, drink, and be merry w/ the rest of us after the hike - do it! </p> <p>It's always nice to have a few people stay w/ the coolers/food while we hike.  And yes, you get some vino while we're away!</p> <p>Directions to ferry:</p> <p>From US 101 heading Northbound Take the Tiburon Blvd exit, turn right, and follow Tiburon Blvd 4 miles into downtown Tiburon. Turn right on Main St. The ferry is located on the left at 21 Main St.</p> <p>From US 101 heading Southbound Same exit as above, except take a left over the overpass. Instructions from overpass are the same as above.</p> <p>Map and Parking Information: Park at any of the banks which will be closed and walk a few blocks to the ferry terminal.</p> <p><img src="http://www.angelislandferry.com/Portals/0/images/ferrymap.gif" /></p> <p>The ferry costs $13.50 (Round trip).  NO CREDIT CARDS  - Bring cash.</p> <p>Meet at the ferry dock at 9:45am -</p> <p>Ferry leaves at 10:00am sharp - they won't wait.</p> <p>GPS  37.873193,-122.455809</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/2/c/e/event_348538062.jpeg" /></p> <p>Return ferry runs 20 past ea hour. I.E. ferry leaves island at 3:20pm, 4:20pm, last ferry is at 5:20pm.</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/c/b/e/event_266603742.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/b/c/event_348534972.jpeg" /></p> <p>Typically several of us ride the last ferry then go to Guaymas for drinks, chips &amp; salsa, and snacks, at the end of the day.  A great way to cap off the day.</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/e/a/event_348534762.jpeg" /></p> <p>This is the largest event of the year, and is posted to several Meetup sites, so plan on a full day of sun, fun, and meeting some cool people.</p>

V<p>DO.NOT.MISS.THIS!!! This will be a siiiiick show with 4 headliners! Huge night for PW!<br/>-------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Tickets: <a href="http://ticketf.ly/1o0SYql" class="linkified">http://ticketf.ly/1o0SYql</a></p> <p>Sunset SF presents the ultimate CRUSH PARTY</p> <p>Green Velvet<br/>Gorgon City<br/>Icey - Official DJ Page<br/>The Scumfrog</p> <p>This isn't a party. It's a feast. A testament to overkill. A show with FOUR HEADLINERS. After last year's sold out Plump DJs / Krafty Kuts blowout Heineken Dome afterparty for the , we had to pull out all the stops. And that we did, bringing you a lineup that has seldom seen its equal in a San Francisco club show. GREEN VELVET is one of the few edm artists whose music has transcended the genre, and whose singing, writing, and musicianship have made him one of the most sought after artists in the world. DJ ICEY is one of the most influential producers of all time, the father of American breakbeat, and one of the finest live Djs on earth. GORGON CITY is one of the hottest production teams on the planet, on the heels of their #4 charting "Ready for Love". And then there's the SCUMFROG, a dj's dj with 25 years of experience making the underground into hallowed ground. They will be joined by local heroes, Lights Down Low Dj's Richie Panic and Corey Sleazemore plus Silent Frisco with Motion Potion Matt Haze and Dj Dials outside. This WILL SELL OUT. So get your tickets NOW.</p>

V<p>Elkhorn Slough is a favorite with the folk that I kayak with. Each paddle there brings something new to watch as natural life goes on around us. In the entire Bay Area, this is one of the best places to kayak.</p> <p>Be on the beach in front of Monterey Bay Kayaks at around 9:30 a.m. and READY TO LAUNCH at 10:00am. After a 2-minute briefing we will head out for a leisurely paddle up the slough to a point just past Seal Bend. There we will either pause for lunch, or--if the group so desires--paddle all the way to Kirby Park. Lunch is in the boat or outside the boat at Kirby Park depending how far the group paddles. We will be with the tides in both directions so this is an excellent paddle for beginners or experienced kayakers. If you don't own your own kayak you can rent from Monterey Bay Kayaks. It's best to reserve a kayak in advance as they do sell out on nice days. To contact for rentals: <a href="http://www.montereybaykayaks.com">www.montereybaykayaks.com</a> or [masked]. If you are going to rent, please show up at MBK before 9:00am. If you are an absolute beginner, I recommend a sit-on-top kayak, and polyester or "wicking" underclothes. MBK will provide you with a wetsuit, PFD, paddle, and paddle jacket as part of their rental package. A wetsuit is always a good idea when paddling in cold water.</p> <p>NOTE: We launch on time. Please show the group the courtesy of being there on time ready to go. There will be experienced paddlers in this group, or the always friendly and knowledgeable staff of MBK, to help you out.</p> <p>If you have a marine VHF transceiver, we will be on channel 78.</p> <p>There is a fee for parking in the Moss Landing Harbor Parking Lot. Get an envelope from the rusty kiosk on the bathroom building, and deposit your parking fee there as well. Note that you need only pay for parking, not launching, as we will not be using the launch ramp.</p> <p>Please no children under the age of 18 or animals.  Thank you.</p>

V<p>Grab that trailbike - it's time for the monthly ride at Soquel Demonstration State Forest (a.k.a. SDSF, a.k.a. Demo), hosted by our friends at MBOSC - Mountain Bikers of Santa Cruz.</p> <p>Intermediate to advanced riders will enjoy the monthly club ride at Demo featuring long climbs and technical descents.</p> <p>Regular re-groups ensure a social, supportive environment. The route is determined by ride participants, but typically consists of a couple loops with an opportunity to bow out after the first. The ride is typically followed by lunch at the Summit Store.</p> <p>Meet at 9:30am to unload your bike and socialize. Wheels roll promptly at 10:00 am. Cross the bridge at Highland Road and meet at the inside parking lot. (Click on the \u201ci\u201d on the map below for directions.) Car pooling is encouraged.</p> <p>Full suspension bikes are recommended; body armor is optional. Helmets are required for all MBoSC rides. You don\u2019t have to be a member to ride. This is a great opportunity to meet local riders and enjoy the abundance of trails in our corner of the world.</p> <p><a href="http://www.wunderground.com/US/CA/Santa_Cruz.html">Check the weather</a> - rain 48 hours before cancels the ride!</p>

V<p>Let's do a hike in the city!</p> <p>From Haight St x Buena Vista Park West St (not East, the street intersects 2 times with Haight) corner of Buena Vista Park, we'll head to the dog run area, then up to the top of the park. From there we'll head to Corona Heights Park through Masonic St. We'll enjoy the views from the top and end at the dog run at the bottom of the hill. There will be opportunities at the dog runs to have your dog off-leash, but since we'll be traversing through some busy city streets, it'll be good to have your dog on a leash.</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aSuggestions for what to bring:</p> <p>\u2022 Water and snacks for you and your dog</p> <p>\u2022 Leash</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Appropriate clothing for changing weather conditions</p> <p>\u2022 Sun protection (sunscreen, hat, sunglasses)</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aWell behaved dogs only. There will be dogs big and small with a range of personalities, so please be mindful of this.</p> <p>Release of Liability: By joining us for this event you hereby release and discharge it's owners, principals, affiliates, presenters, organizer, hosts and participants from any and all liability, claims, demands or causes of action that you now have, or may have in the future, for injuries, damages, death and/or economic loss of any kind or nature, arising in whole or in part out of the activities, advice or information contained herein.</p>

V<p>What if there were a free tool that you could use any time, any place... to contact deep inner wisdom and healing?</p> <p>What if this tool had been used for millennia - and also updated to suit the unique needs of contemporary Westerners?</p> <p>What if this tool could help you feel more alive, purposeful, joyful, connected to yourself and to Spirit? - and could also help you heal past trauma, dysfunctional relationship patterns, anxiety, depression, addictions, compulsions, and almost anything else that causes you pain and imbalance?</p> <p>Guess what? There IS such a tool, and it's called the shamanic journey.</p> <p><br/>The shamanic journeying method I teach comes from Core Shamanism, a technique synthesized by anthropologist Michael Harner based on his study of many diverse cultures throughout the world. As such, we all have equal birthright to it, no matter who we are or where we're from... and, it works for all of us.</p> <p><br/>Deceptively simple yet amazingly profound, the shamanic journey can transform your life. I know that's a bold claim! Yet I make it because it has transformed my own life, and the lives of hundreds of students and clients to whom I've taught it over the years.</p> <p><br/>At this class, suitable for beginners OR more advanced practitioners, we'll:</p> <p>\u2022 Go over the basics of safe shamanic journeying. (There are some very important things NOT to do, as well as some practices and understandings that will help you journey more easily and effectively.)</p> <p>\u2022 We'll do an initial journey to help everyone present make contact with an inner guide (or deepen your contact, if you're already working with a guide.)</p> <p>\u2022 We'll explore the most powerful healing practices available in shamanism, how to prepare for them, and how to enlist your guides' assistance in implementing them.</p> <p><br/>\u2022 We'll do a second journey in which you can start on one of these advanced healing practices... or continue deepening your connection with your guide or with non-ordinary reality. (Everyone can journey! But everyone moves through the process at a different pace, and I aim to teach in a manner that allows each person support to go where they need to go, at their own speed and in their own way.)</p> <p>\u2022 We'll close with some discussion and practice of how you can keep these powerful tools and understandings alive and growing in your life - even in a culture that doesn't understand or support them :)</p> <p>If you haven't come to a Meetup with me before, check out the reviews for previous gatherings. These classes are always amazing - and I say that without boasting. I'm a good teacher, but what really makes the classes life-changing are the wise, loving, compassionate beings who work with me and through me - and who are available to work with and through you, too!</p> <p>For more info about me, please feel free to check out my website, &lt;a&gt;www.EvolutionarySupport.com.&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>&lt;a&gt;Oh, and a note about fees. The fee I charge is the lowest I'm aware of in the Bay Area for a day of powerful, guided shamanic practice. But I'm committed to making this work available to as many people as possible - so as long as there are at least 5 full-fee participants, I am open to working out partial scholarships with other folks who want to come on an as-needed basis.  So if you need that, let me know :)&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>&lt;a&gt;Hope to see you on August 10!<br/>&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>In love and healing,</p> <p>Ruth</p>

V<p>"For over 45 years San Jose Municipal Golf Course has been called home to thousands of south bay golfers. With a tremendous location near the major freeways of 101,880, &amp; 280 this hangout is easy to get to. A straight forward layout with open fairways on flat terrain offers a pleasant experience for golfers of all abilities. It's the perfect course if you like to walk. A course that is always in excellent condition, the championship yardage has been increased with construction of several new tee boxes. From the tips "the muni" plays well over 6700 yards. While not the punishing round featured at some of the newly designed courses (that's a relief), San Jose Municipal Golf Course is sure to provide a challenging, enjoyable day of golf."</p>

This class is designed for BEGINNERS.</p> <p>sliding scale $15-$25</p> <p>HAPPY ESBAT! -Esbat is a Pagan meeting held during the full moon where healing magic is performed!</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/1/5/4/600_387349492.jpeg" /></p> <p>***MY SUMMER HEALING PACKAGE!!!!!</p> <p>For the summer I\u2019m offering a special 2 month package consisting of one 60 min Tarot reading and 2 follow up 90 minute Intuitive Coaching &amp; Tarot Readings for only $195. This is an $80 savings.</p> <p>The first 60 min session is designed to illuminate your current life story, where you\u2019re headed and what your potential life purpose is revealing. From this first session I\u2019ll assign homework and recommend readings. The following two sessions will be a hybrid of intuitive coaching -maintaining your success vision, the strategy to get there and your mindset coupled with relaxation techniques and a ceremonial Tarot Reading/Healing to help encapsulate the previous days/weeks work. This program has empowered and inspired many clients and jumped started change, flow and a general sense of purpose.</p> <p>Please feel free to email me with any questions or to set up a phone consultation @ [masked]</p> <p><a href="http://www.laurazuspan.com/tarot/">www.laurazuspan.com/tarot/</a></p> <p>as always I\u2019m also available for single readings :)!</p> <p>Testimonial:</p> <p>\u201cSometimes our hearts need to open to the realm of new possibilities. Sometimes the path in front of us is hidden by distractions. Shift is inevitable. Laura is deeply intuitive and can hold space as your cards unfold. She engages without judgement, patiently listens while we learn and sends us home feeling light, calm and clear.\u201d</p> <p>-Hannah Weiss, Midwife in Oakland</p>

V<p>Second Sunday of the month tabletop gaming at the Case house.</p> <p>These Sunday gaming sessions give us time to play some longer games. The focus, as always, is on hobbyist board games -- mostly strategy games. The genres include Eurogames, Ameritrash, abstract and other moderate to complex strategy games.</p> <p>We do let our hair down for the occasional party game or light game, but there's little interest in word games.</p> <p>Bring your own favorite beverage and snacks. Paperware and plastic utensils will be available, as well as refrigerator space.</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Loyd Case</p>

V<p>El Rio is a San Francisco institution, it has been around for decades, and it shines on Sunday afternoons because its back patio is glorious! They have been longtime supporters of the local community and queer charities.</p> <p>The crowd is mixed, straight and queer, and everyone is there to relax in the sun and have a good time.</p> <p>Stop by Taqueria Cancun across the street to pick up some food, and bring it here (yes that's fine) to enjoy with a Bloody Mary (they have a Bloody Mary bar). Sometimes they invite food vendors to the patio, so you may not even need to go elsewhere for food.</p> <p>The bar opens at 1pm, so we will be among the first people there to claim our space under the sun.</p> <p>For those who want to stick around, beginner salsa lessons start at 3:15pm and a live salsa band starts playing at 4pm!</p> <p>See you there!</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<img src="http://nearby-pla.net/vault/public/2014-06-22ersf2.png" /></p>

V<p><b>Conservation Photography Class<br/>Fundamentals of Exposure</b><br/>Gary Sharlow, <i>Photographer, Education Manager</i></p> <p><b>Sunday, August 10th at 1:00pm</b><br/>In this three-hour classroom presentation, you will learn about the inner workings of your DSLR camera. This class is designed as an overview to help you better understand your camera, the digital workflow and how to make better images. We cover basic features of the DSLR camera to include choosing lenses and filters, ISO, white balance, shutter, aperture and program modes, EV, exposure, bracketing, focusing, resolution, histograms and more. The main objective is to help you understand the fundamentals of exposure so that you can get your camera out of auto mode and start making images the way you want them to look. Once you have the skills to get the correct exposure under any conditions, we can shift our efforts to proper techniques for focus, light metering, depth of field and some basic rules of composition.</p> <p><b>Please Note:</b> Entrance is via the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/AXrv">Academy's Staff and Research Entrance</a> at the back door located at 75 Nancy Pelosi Drive. You will <b>not be permitted entry</b> at the front door. Please arrive at least 10 minutes early.</p> <p><b>Reservations:</b> Members: $40, General $50. Seating is limited and advanced ticketing is required. To reserve a place today, buy a <a href="https://ticketing.calacademy.org/webstore/shop/viewitems.aspx?&amp;CG=AcademyLectures&amp;c=MEMBERconservephoto1">Member</a> or <a href="https://ticketing.calacademy.org/webstore/shop/viewitems.aspx?&amp;CG=AcademyLectures&amp;c=GAconservephoto1">Non-Member</a> ticket online or over the phone at 1-[masked]</p>

V<p>Folks its that time of year again when Stern Grove opens its gates to the beautiful park and puts on FREE concerts every Sunday throughout the summer!</p> <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT TO GUARANTEE A SPOT WITH OUR GROUP YOU MUST RSVP ON ONE BRICK WEBSITE HERE: <a href="http://sfbay.onebrick.org/event/?eventid=14965" class="linkified">http://sfbay.onebrick.org/event/?eventid=14965</a> - spots are limited!</p> <p>No real British theme to this event - but who doesn't like a Sunday afternoon in the park listening to decent music, sipping on a glass or two and enjoying a picnic?</p> <p>This event combines several of my passions in life (three mentioned above!) - one of the main one's being giving back to the community.  So why not join me in volunteering at Stern Grove?  Its an easy introduction to a wonderful volunteer organisation called One Brick (onebrick.org). The tasks are simple - prior to the concert and during the interval we are part of the bucket brigade going round collecting donations from the crowd.  In return for these tasks Stern Grove provide us free parking and seats at one or two of the picnic tables with the best views of the concert! Once the event is over we help clear those picnic tables, recycle a few bottles &amp; things, and help organise the recycling bins for collection later.  </p> <p>Legendary vocalist Darlene Love headlines the afternoon at the Grove with her powerhouse vocals and classic Motown sound.  Bay Area favorite Monophonics open the show with their signature psychedelic soul and heavy funk sound. More details here: <a href="http://www.sterngrove.org/home/concertsevents/2014-season/schedule/august-10/" class="linkified">http://www.sterngrove.org/home/concertsevents/2014-season/schedule/august-10/</a></p> <p>Either join us volunteering (please RSVP on One Brick site) or just come down anyway to enjoy the show!  If you are not volunteering we recommend getting there for around 11a.m. to get a good spot in the park.  Volunteer - and you can just stroll up around 1:15pm!</p>

V<p>This pathway with cement stairs called "Belalp Path" is in the Upper Rockridge area. It connects the streets of Golden Gate &amp; Buena Vista. The Golden Gate Ave. side is at the stair's bottom so we will begin there. The approximate address to find it on Google Maps is "5188 Golden Gate Ave., Oakland, Ca". It is between 2 houses with the addresses of 5176 and 5200 Golden Gate Ave.</p> <p>One should bring gloves, water to drink, paper towels and a map. Good things to bring are shearers, brooms, dust pans and even a rake or hoe. I will bring 3 shearers and enough garbage bags. I will post photos of what "Belalp Path" looks like now and more information on what tools we should bring. If we finish this one block of "Belalp Path" we may also work on "Belalp Path" as it goes up higher on the other side of Buena Vista Ave.</p> <p>We will work for about 2 hours, but it is OK to arrive late and only stay one hour.</p> <p>Below is the bottom of Belalp Path.</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/9/6/2/600_258583362.jpeg" /></p> <p>Below photo shows pretty flowering plant that plants itself, Jupiter's Beard.</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/c/f/8/600_387112472.jpeg" /></p> <p>The bottom.</p>

V<p>Bethany Healed from Life in a Wheelchair; What Can You Overcome?</p> <p>The film \u201cBethany\u2019s Story\u201d, produced by the non-profit health and wellness organization SanaView, documents a girl\u2019s illness from its onset to recovery. It reveals how food, not medication, consistently proves to be a dominant factor in healing and reversing illness and disease. Illustrating these points are interviews with leading medical and nutrition experts such as Neal Barnard, MD, founder of Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine; Michael Gregor, MD, founder of NutritionFacts.org; Gabriel Cousens, MD; Dr. Brian Clement; Brenda Davis RD, and Lewis Mehl-Madrona, MD.</p> <p>View the trailer of this film at <a href="http://sanaview.com/bethanys-story.aspx?affiliateswap=SMC" class="linkified">http://sanaview.com/bethanys-story.aspx?affiliateswap=SMC</a>.</p> <p>At age thirteen, Bethany was left paralyzed from a series of bad reactions to medication. For years doctors told her she would never walk again. On her own, Bethany discovered and adopted a vegan (raw) plant-based diet and within a short amount of time she was out of her chair standing and walking. \u201cOur body has this amazing ability to rejuvenate and repair and regenerate,\u201d says Dr. Michael Gregor.</p> <p>The film chronicles Bethany\u2019s illness from onset to recovery and includes heart-wrenching accounts from her friends and family. Understanding and witnessing some of the incredible challenges this family encountered truly shows the impact serious health issues have on everyone. Hearing the scientific facts presented by all of the medical experts brings this solution fully to the forefront. As Dr. Gabriel Cousens states in the film, \u201cThese are not miracles. We have the science that makes it very clear,\u201d shows that this is not just an anecdotal account of one odd story, but a scientifically proven solution. Dr. Brian Clement states that raw foods is not a fad but a proven solution that is here to stay.</p> <p>The film's director and founder of the SanaView non-profit organization, Janet McKee, hopes the audience becomes inspired to begin making better choices with food and lifestyle:</p> <p>"I\u2019ve known for some time that food choices are critical for good physical health, but after working on this film, I have no doubt in my mind that there is no greater medicine than food for true healing of the body...Inspiration is the first step to helping others make positive changes, and this film is a key tool to create the desire in others," says McKee.</p> <p>"We have had so many people tell us how the film has changed their lives, and some, too, who have had amazing recoveries from illness when they changed their diet. I feel such gratitude in my heart to have the opportunity to be part of this movement."</p>

V<p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/2/a/600_387910282.jpeg" /></p> <p>As dementia continues to affect millions of elderly Americans, Alive Inside: A Story of Music &amp; Memory reveals a remarkable, music-based breakthrough that has already transformed lives. Spearheaded by social worker Dan Cohen and captured on camera over the course of three years by filmmaker Michael Rossato-Bennett, we learn that songs from a patient's past can awaken memories and emotions that have been asleep for years, sometimes decades. Within a moment of hearing "I Get Around" by the Beach Boys, Alzheimer's patient Marylou jolts back to life, dancing around the living room and expressing a euphoria her husband hasn't witnessed since her illness took effect. Countless instances in Alive Inside provide proof that music stimulates activity in dementia-affected parts of the brain and transforms the quality of life of those often left to languish in silence. Through revealing conversations with renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks and musician Bobby McFerrin, as well as powerful firsthand experiments conducted by Cohen in nursing homes, this groundbreaking documentary demonstrates how connecting the elderly to the music they love not only combats memory loss but also supplements a broken health-care system often indifferent to interpersonal connections.<br/>(Review from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2593392/">IMDB</a>)</p> <p><b>Dinner Discussion:</b> Afterwards, we'll meet to discuss the film and the Enneagram over dinner at a nearby restaurant. Suggestions welcome!</p> <p><b>Questions to Guide Discussion:</b> We may discuss some or all of the topics here: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/EnneagramFilmClub-SF/pages/Discussion_Questions/">Discussion Questions</a>. It may help to refer to the list before watching the film.</p> <p><b>Note About Experience Level:</b> We will use the Enneagram numbers to identify the personality types. If you are new to the system, we strongly advise you to familiarize yourself with the various types and their numbers beforehand in order to better follow the conversation. Introductory information is available on the internet including T<a href="http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/begin.asp">he Enneagram Institute's "How to Begin with the Enneagram"</a></p> <p>NR -- 73 minutes</p>

We do this for the love of community theater and for YOUR enjoyment!  Orinda Parks and Recreation charges for the use of the stage. The publishers/agents charge between $75 and $100 per performance.  The cost of lumber, fasteners and paint run well over $1,000. Used furniture, necessary props and costumes, etc., etc., all add up quickly.  We get no civic funding.  Ticket sales, program ads, and concessions are our only revenue, so your donations of cash or materials help tremendously.  If you are able to contribute, I would honor you greatly. And, of course, you are welcome to come down and participate in our fun!</p> <p>- Geotty Chapple, President</p> <p> </p> <p><b><i></p> <p>\u000a\u000a </i></b></p>

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. In <i>The Sixth Extinction</i>, two-time winner of the National Magazine Award and <i>New Yorker</i> writer Elizabeth Kolbert draws on the work of scores of researchers in half a dozen disciplines, accompanying many of them into the field: geologists who study deep ocean cores, botanists who follow the tree line as it climbs up the Andes, marine biologists who dive off the Great Barrier Reef. She introduces us to a dozen species, some already gone, others facing extinction, including the Panamian golden frog, staghorn coral, the great auk, and the Sumatran rhino. Through these stories, Kolbert provides a moving account of the disappearances occurring all around us and traces the evolution of extinction as concept, from its first articulation by Georges Cuvier in revolutionary Paris up through the present day. The sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy; as Kolbert observes, it compels us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.</p>

V<p>The full moon in August is a "super" full moon! It rises at 7:58 and the  sunset is at 8:05. We'll meet at our favorite full moon spot at the park indicated above. The park closes at 8:30.</p> <p>The park is BIG.... so, <b>to find us, use the address above and LOOK at the Google map</b>. The green arrow points to the exact location where we meet. From 101, you'll go east on Embarcadero Rd, and pass the PA airport (will be on your left); take a left at the T; go past the duck pond (also on your left). After that, bear right and proceed to a gravel parking lot at the end of the road. The place where we drum is an area of soft gravel between the parking area and an arrangement of big concrete blocks.</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/2/d/8/event_268897592.jpeg" /></p> <p>There is no seating, so bring your chair, stool, or something else to sit on.

V<p><b>Make new friends who share your interest in <a href="http://www.morethantwo.com/polyamory.html">polyamory</a> here on the San Francisco Bay Area's peninsula!</b></p> <p>Come on down to the cafe and revive yourself with food, folks, and frivolity!</p> <p>This monthly social get-together is open to polyamorous or poly-curious people and their partners. It's an informal social, not a formal discussion group; you don't have to talk about being poly, but it's a safe place to. Our crowd skews young \u2014 mostly folks in their twenties and thirties \u2014 but well-behaved persons of all ages are welcome.</p> <p>To find us, look in the back room for a stuffed animal on one of the tables, and the laughing, mingling crowd.  We've been getting roughly 30 people lately.  (If you want think it's crowded, maybe you could suggest a different venue?) Please RSVP to encourage folks here at Meetup.com by showing them we're well attended, and please review the event afterwards to share how great a time you had.</p> <p>If possible, please support our continued use of this charming cafe by making a purchase. <a href="http://coupacafe.com/">Coupa Cafe</a> has a great menu and a wide selection of drinks and eats and treats.</p> <p>Please note that we are a social group, and one dedicated to polyamory. While those who practice swinging and other forms of consensual non-monogamy are welcome at our events, aggressive 'cruising' is forbidden. Thank you for helping us maintain a friendly, no-pressure atmosphere. This is a female co-organized, diversity friendly event.</p>

Though my daughter is an advanced reader, I have had previous challenges creating an environment where she would get into writing. <b>Shu-Hsien and Royd were able to get the group of kids to enthusiastically write.</b> Students shared their works at the end of the week with oral readings. <b>The teachers are excellent about using various strategies to tap into what works for the individual student</b> and <b>use interactive group work to start the thinking process</b> moving for the young writers....My <b>daughter came home from the workshop so happy and content</b>, the way she can be after a long stretch of time engrossed in an activity."<br/><b>  ~ Julie, Parent of 8-year-old writer</b></p> <p><b>Writing Coaches Shu-Hsien Ho and Royd Hatta</b> are passionate about teaching youth and teens how to organize their thoughts and write with power, clarity and ease. Since 1996, their students have learned to write essays, research reports, poems, short stories, and even their first novels. After working with Ms. Ho, one teen writer independently published her 400-page fantasy novel. Their students have gotten accepted into top colleges and universities, such as UC San Diego, Carnegie Mellon, Caltech, MIT, NYU, and Brown University. Ms. Ho has a B.A. from Pomona College and an M.A. from Lesley University. Mr. Hatta has a B.A. from the California State University at Long Beach, with specialties in history, art, theater, and philosophy. Ms. Ho and Mr. Hatta currently teach small group workshops for homeschooling groups and at the Chinese American International School in San Francisco. They run two thriving writers clubs with over 420 families: Bay Area Young Writers and Bay Area Teen Writers. In the last two years, Ms. Ho and Mr. Hatta published four anthologies of their students\u2019 fiction: <i>Strokes of Lightning</i>, <i>Real Heroes Wear Sneakers,</i> <i>Bones of Mystery,</i> and <i>Encroaching Ink</i>. They are currently compiling and editing stories for the 2014 anthologies.</p> <p> </p> <p>A local artist and art teacher, <b>Smita Garg</b> has taught art classes and workshops to children and adults throughout the San Francisco Bay Area including public and private schools; Next Door, a local women's shelter; the Moreland Area Community Center (MACC); the India Community Center (ICC), and the Art of Living Foundation's youth program.

As a Warrior she has loved choosing her own mission and fate, sometimes to the detriment of her success! When someone says \u201cGo left\u201d\u2026she wants to go right! It wasn\u2019t until she was introduced to Napoleon Hill that her business world changed. Then she realized that her gift to the world is bringing women in business together in the spirit of MasterMind to organize their knowledge and actually earn what they deserve. Crazy part, is she has always been a speaker\u2026.she actually started in toastmasters in the 7th grade! She competed in oratory in high school and had the honor of speaking on the same stage as the Reverend Jesse Jackson in 1985. WAAAAYYYYYY back in the 90\u2019s she was a speaker for CareerTrack, Fred Pryor Seminars, and National Seminars Group. With over 600 speakers, she was in the top 1% of Back of Room sales and the only woman! As a business owner, no matter WHAT YOU SELL, speaking is one of the smartest strategies to getting clients now, but without a presentation that converts you are just inspiring, or very helpful. Ann now shows entrepreneurs how to get out of their own way, organize what they do, present it to audiences and sell more with ease. ANY business can use this skill as a gateway to closing more business.</p> <p>$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $</p> <p><br/>Successful Thinkers Network is a group of like minded and committed individuals who believe people will buy or use product / service from people they like, know, and trust.  Building relationship is key to the membership in helping others move forward.  Members share ideas and information to benefit the community and their business.</p> <p>The Successful Thinkers Network's mission is to help develop relationships that will enable members to find solutions to business challenges.  Attend our meetings to learn more about how our concept works for you and your business.</p> <p><b>VERY IMPORTANT: There is no cost for the event.  We just ask you to support the local economy by ordering lunch from our host restaurant.</b></p> <p>The group meets every Monday from 11:30am to 1:30pm.  Everyone is welcome!</p>

V<p>Dear Uniting-the-Generations Community,</p> <p>How will your participation in our community help make the world a better place for your children and future generations?</p> <p>Imagine what it would be like to tap into the collective wisdom of diverse and dedicated individuals representing all four generations of your larger community?</p> <p>Starting on Aug. 11th , 2014, you'll have the opportunity to participate in the 1st of 8 interactive workshops designed to discover new ways of looking at the crises we now face on so many fronts--social, financial &amp; environmental.  "How will this help?  What can one community group do to change anything?" you may ask.</p> <p>Fear grows out of a mistaken notion that these crises are so huge they can only be addressed from the top down.  The change that will truly solve most problems in our individual lives, our society and indeed our world is not just a change of policy, a new law, a new president or a tighter regulation, but a fundamental <i>change of mind and heart</i>.  The change required now must come from the grassroots--from individual changes that ultimately create a contagion of change in homes, neighborhoods and workplaces.  This change starts with you and me in the fundamental way we engage with the world.</p> <p>Let's come together and collectively begin to increase our understanding and application of the new discoveries in such fields as neuroscience, epigenetics, quantum physics and the social sciences.  For too long science has separated to study.  These new sciences unite in ways that demand we begin the work of actually rewriting what we call the fabric and structure of reality, or our worldview.</p> <p>When you join us you'll learn: </p> <p>\u2022 How you can identify the character &amp; social conditions influencing the 4 different generations to better utilize the gifts each has to offer</p> <p><br/>\u2022 You will understand how these characteristics, conditions and the archetype each generation represents repeat throughout history to evolve humanity</p> <p><br/>\u2022 And space will be provided for you to connect to your new community to discover where you are now and what sort of future you want to build</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a<i>"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."    </i></p> <p><br/><i>-</i> Margaret Mead</p>

V<p>As browsers become more powerful, our users are coming to expect more visually complex and engaging experiences. Some of the most impressive effects can come from appropriate use of 3D animation, taking advantage of the newest features in HTML5 and the power of WebGL. So we thought it was a good time to take a look at how these tools and techniques can factor into our own web applications today.</p> <p>We'll be reading Tony Parisi's new book, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029205.do">Programming 3D Applications with HTML5 and WebGL</a>. It takes the reader from the basics through some of the latest patterns and frameworks, and discusses both how and when to use them. </p> <p>Note: We're pushing the date of this meeting back a week to August 11 to accommodate the schedule of the author, Tony Parisi. We're excited that Tony plans to join us to discuss his book with the group, so read well, and prepare some interesting questions!</p> <p>Looking forward to another lively discussion!</p>

V<p>Hey story lovers! Who's up for a little field trip?</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aFor this meetup we will be checking out The Moth Story Slam at the Rickshaw Stop!</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Moth is a monthly feature at the Rickshaw Stop where local storytellers take the mic and and tell their story within a few minutes. Each event has a different theme, and this time, the stories are revolving around the theme of "Beauty".</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aJoin us to listen to some fresh stories, people watch, and then possibly check out a nearby bar?</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aTickets for the event are $8, and you can get them here:  <a href="http://themoth.org/events?category=37&amp;month=2014-08"><a href="http://themoth.org/events?category=37&amp;month=2014-08" class="linkified">http://themoth.org/events?category=37&amp;month=2014-08</a></a></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aThere is also a nearby paid parking lot, but it's also walking distance from public transit. (Either the Civic Center BART station, or the Van Ness MUNI station)</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aDoors open at 6:30, with storytellers taking the stage at 7:00. I'll be there on the earlier side, and will hang out for a bit outside so we can meet up before the storytelling starts. </p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aThe more the merrier in this one, so feel free to bring a guest! Looking forward to seeing you there!</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a<img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/7/3/0/600_385590512.jpeg" /></p>

V<p>Hola a todos,</p> <p>Come join us for some margarita / sangria / wine drinking fun all while chatting in Spanish! Rosa Mexicano (and that's correct, not "Mexicana" since it refers to a type of Mexican pink) is an awesome meeting spot for our group. We take over the side section in this large open-doored restaurant, next to the bar, enjoy some tapitas and get to know each other in Spanish. This Mega section attracts many members, so if you want to get a spot RSVP right away. Likewise, update your RSVP if your plans change to open up a spot, since we almost always have a waiting list.</p> <p>So how does it work? Simple, show up, introduce yourself and chat in Spanish (ONLY). Most people are coming on their own as well, so you will be the "norm" if you are too. Everyone is very welcoming and friendly. All levels are welcome, with the only rule being it is a Spanish only event (occasionally, by the way, we do post "Spanish optional" events). This group has many native speakers who are regulars, many advanced speakers who lived in Spanish-speaking countries for years, and a fair amount of learners. We tend to stay on our feet to promote mingling and meeting and socializing with more people.</p> <p>These events are FREE, but anyone joining will need to purchase one drink or food item. This is to keep our venues happy (and sorry, water doesn't count as "one" drink ;  ) This is important since without your participation in keeping venues happy they might make us "guarantee the bar" or pay for the space. As long as you order a little bit of this or that, it will be good enough. And, oh yea, don't forget to tip :  )</p> <p>Hope you can come join our fun group soon!</p> <p>Un abrazo a todos, y os veo muy pronto,</p> <p>Rachel</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a </p> <p> </p>

V<p>Join Bryan Vu (Google) as he shares his work on a deep dive into a new coin mixing protocol to improve anonymity in Bitcoin. The protocol is called CoinShuffle.</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/5/e/a/600_387574282.jpeg" /></p> <p>The key innovation in CoinShuffle is that it is decentralized and it does not require a mixing server. Among other advantages, this means that no mixing server learns which output addresses and input addresses in a mixing transaction belong together. Since CoinShuffle is based on the idea of CoinJoin, theft of coins is excluded as well. CoinShuffle does not require complex cryptography and performs well in practice, even in scenarios with a large number (about 50) of participants.

V<p>We're songwriters looking for a little more depth to our lives and our art. Whether it's a curse-laden punk song, a soaring gospel number or activist hip-hop, we are open to any and all songwriters who identify as "soul-seeking."</p> <p>We'll give each other 7 minutes each to be fully heard. That's enough time for you to sing a couple of songs, or to get feedback, or to start a discussion, or to jam with others. The time is yours as you choose.</p> <p>We will meet every second Monday of the month at 7:30 at The Launching Pad, a home for young adults affiliated with the Centers for Spiritual Living. This event is also co-hosted by the Unitarian Universalist Young Adults. All genres, all generations, all faiths (and non-faiths), all flavors of truth-seeking are welcome, as long as you are open.</p>

We welcome anyone to attend a GoRampUp! meeting, once, for free as our guest, so you can learn what the innovative GoRampUp! business-networking experience is all about. Note, we are not able to give you a free meeting at more than one of our many locations.</p> <p>YOU MUST obtain a free-access GoRampUp! Golden ticket by registering for a specific meeting at<a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar/"><a href="http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/" class="linkified">http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/</a></a>. This ticket must be presented at your complimentary meeting for you to gain admittance. Without this ticket you will, unfortunately, be declined access to our innovative and exclusive business-networking meeting. WITH a GoRampUp!

We're informal and fun, yet, by design, we're extremely effective!</p> <p>We help people who work for a living to get a much greater payoff from working. We do this in three specific ways under our three CoreSuccess Platforms: 1) We help you move toward mastery with business-networking, 2) We help you move toward mastery with business performance, and, 3) We help you move toward mastery with personal development.</p> <p>How do we deliver on this promise to our community members? Each month we conduct dozens of business-networking meetings in more than a dozen cities in the SF Bay Area. A member may attend all of our "OpenConnect" business-networking meetings. And our members are welcome and encouraged to attend any and all of these meetings and locations.</p> <p>Each month we introduce and emphasize a learning and development subject under each of our three CoreSuccess Platforms. For each of the three learning and development subjects that we introduce and emphasize each month, we give you four different ways to learn it: We produce written learning guides, video learning guides, audio learning guide, and we cover the subjects as 15-to-20-minute mini-workshops inside of our 60-minute business-networking meetings. There's no registration or initiation fee to join. Membership in GoRampUp! is month to month. You enroll when you like, even mid-month, and you depart when you like.</p> <p>Be sure to see our website to learn about <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/growrampup">our generous enrollment incentives</a></p> <p>Also, be sure to learn about our <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/norisk">100-Satisfaction Money-Back Guarantee</a></p> <p>Would you care to come to this meeting, at no cost, to see if there\u2019s business-value for you?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">Free-Meeting Guest-RSVP and Golden Ticket Request</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">View complete meeting details</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/invite">Invite a Buddy to join you</a></p> <p>One last thing: You REALLY should check out actual testimonial videos by our members: <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/why">See them here</a></p> <p>This page was created to produce awareness of our event.

V<p><b>Increase the ROI in your Business with Strengths</b></p> <p><b>Strengths Crash Course</b></p> <p>Many of us fall for the illusion of being \u201cwell rounded.\u201d When we run a business, often times we end up <i>becoming</i> the business instead of being the owners of one. One of the <b>biggest mistakes business owners make is failing to play to their strengths</b> and complementing with strength based teams! When you focus on strengths with your teams, engagement increases by more than 15%! How would an extra 15% engagement serve your business and impact your bottom line? Whether you have employees or not, you have a team, you just don\u2019t know it yet. Do you <i>invest</i> the majority of you time playing to your Strengths or do you <i>spend</i> your time attempting to improve your weaknesses?</p> <p>Come join us! These will be your takeaways:</p> <p>\u2022  Discover how <b>Strengths add depth to branding yourself</b> and your business</p> <p>\u2022  <b>Maximize your Team Structure</b> \u2013 How do you lead?</p> <p>\u2022  <b>Creating a more engaged workforce</b> \u2013 you are the leader of your business, are YOU engaged?</p> <p>When we put our Authenticity to work, it pays!

V<p>Hi Boomer Babes,</p> <p><br/>For our August get-together, we reserved the Club Room in my condo complex for a afternoon potluck lunch. </p> <p>Bring your favorite potluck foods (+ serving utensils) that you can share with your Boomer buddies. We\u2019re hoping to get a good mix of appetizers, salads, main dishes, desserts.  Linda &amp; I will provide disposable cups, plates, utensils, napkins, tablecloths.</p> <p>Remember to <b>BYO BEVERAGES</b>\u2014you don\u2019t want to get thirsty!! </p> <p>If the weather cooperates, there's an outdoor patio where we can eat and chat.  AND/OR we can go to the 10th floor roof for San Francisco Bay views. Elevators take you to the 9th floor; then 14 stair-steps to the top.</p> <p>After sharing the yummy good eats, fun and laughter, the Embarcadero is just steps away. You'll find plenty of sights and attractions within walking distance: Pier 39, Levi Plaza, SF Cruise Ship Terminal, Exploratorium, Ferry Building. </p> <p>See you soon!</p>

V<p>Nowadays, we are using JavaScript more and more on our webpages, and that means that we can end up with hundreds or even thousands of lines of JS. If you're not careful, your code can quickly become an unnavigable maze of spaghetti code. Most web developers are now using Object-oriented concepts to help them modularize their code and make it more re-usable.</p> <p><br/>In this evening workshop, we'll give an overview of Object-oriented JavaScript, and spend most of our time actually getting our hands dirty using those concepts.</p> <p>As a prerequisite, you should be fairly familiar with JS, like by having attended our JS workshop and advanced JS workshops in jQuery and AJAX. Bring a laptop, a charger, and a smile.</p> <p>If you're interested in being a teaching assistant, please let us know.</p> <p><br/>Thanks to <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> <a href="http://change.org">&lt;/a&gt;for the great space.</p> <p>If you'd like to attend but cannot afford the cost, please &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHRPTms0blNlTlo3cUpySFJENzBEdWc6MQ"&gt;request a GDI scholarship</a>.</p>

V<p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/f/8/600_384866872.jpeg" /></p> <p>Part 1: The Zen of Visualization: Exploring the dance between seeing and creating beautiful images.</p> <p>A near death experience and the teachings of a Zen Buddhist monk transformed the vision and opened the heart of this photographic artist.  When seeing with the full awareness of physical, emotional and spiritual bodies, an energetic exchange takes place between the photographer and subject. Sharing this vision, one hopes that the viewer takes in the resulting photograph in such a way that they may sense beyond thought, the intention of the photographer, as well as discover their own inner wisdom.</p> <p><b><i>\u201cOne should not only photograph things for what they are but for what else they are.\u201d \u2013 Minor White </i></b></p> <p>Lisa Winston is a graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology an award-winning photographer and creative and spiritual mentor. Lisa will share photographs and direct experience of how her vision and creative process has evolved through contemplative inquiry. Her mantra is \u201cLive in Beauty through the wisdom and alchemy of creative expression.\u201d</p> <p><br/>Lisa's Web site:  <a href="http://ljwdivinesight.us/"><a href="http://ljwdivinesight.us" class="linkified">http://ljwdivinesight.us</a></a></p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/a/7/4/600_384867252.jpeg" /></p> <p>Part 2: Making What is Imagined Real.</p> <p><b><i>\u201cThe camera doesn't make a bit of difference. All of them can record what you are seeing. But, you have to SEE\u201d. - Ernst Haas</i></b></p> <p>"My first step when I started a new architectural project was to review the publications I respected.  For a job in Florida, Southern California or another southern state it was Décor de Provence, Côté Sud and LUX.   The goal was twofold.  First, to become aware of new photographic styles and bring something new and valuable to my clients. Second, and most importantly, I was priming my mind\u2019s eye for the critical first step in creating great photographs, the ability to see and form a mental image that would meet my clients goals. </p> <p><b><i>\u201cYou don't take a photograph, you make it.\u201d Ansel Adams</i></b></p> <p>The next and equally important step is working with the craft of photography to make what is imagined visible.  He will discuss how to use the camera\u2019s manual settings and the Zone System to create consistent high-quality images that are also faster and easier to produce.</p> <p>Glen Graves attended the Brooks Institute in the mid 1970s and established a successful career as a freelance commercial / architectural / personal photographer.  He has traveled nationwide working for companies such as General Motors, Ford, FTD, Formica, Delta Faucets, the Lear Corporation, the New York Port Authority and innumerable Architectural firms and related companies.  He has been published in Architectural Digest,  the Robb Report and every major shelter publication.  <br/>He is now the happy warrior teaching photography classes and shooting for a few select clients. He is also Vice President and Educational Coordinator for the Marin Photography Club = FYI - Best job yet !!</p> <p>Marin Photography Club members can attend for Free - non-members are asked for a $5.00 donation to fund future Education events. </p> <p>Glen's web site: <a href="http://www.ggravesphoto.com/"><a href="http://www.ggravesphoto.com" class="linkified">http://www.ggravesphoto.com</a></a></p>

V<p>This is the first in a monthly meeting to discuss new collaboration projects. This will be completely informal at a Mission District pub. If you have a project you would like help with, this meetup will be to get the ball rolling. You can trade services with someone, or try to find like minded people to build something that could become a startup company. You can volunteer services to help you learn a new skill or for a philanthropic or otherwise interesting project. Also, if you have ideas on how this meetup group can facilitate collaboration please come by and let us know.</p> <p>How to find us: This is a pretty big place. We will be inside the venue (not on the patio) along the wall on the left side as you come in. I will have on a black baseball cap. Text if you can't find us - [masked].</p>

V<p>How does the book swap work? Bring a book of your choice that you are willing to give away. Each book swapper will draw a number at approximately 7:45pm. Number 1 will select the book they would like first, then number 2, and so on. Then the remaining books on the table people can take if something interests them. Usually if you bring a book or two, you take a book or two, but there are no strict rules about the number you bring and the number you take. There are almost always books leftover that we "donate" to the Library Bar.  Oh, and feel free to grab a drink or two as well.  Let's keep our bartenders happy at Rex, so if you don't order a drink, please order food and be sure to tip regardless.  See you there!</p>

V<p>"True happiness is not about circumstances, physical health, financial success, or even about the people in our lives. In other words, it\u2019s <b>not</b> about the factors that are frequently beyond our control."</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/e/3/e/600_384607742.jpeg" /></p> <p>Tonight we will be viewing one of six videos with Dr. Henry Cloud, based on his book "The Law of Happiness." Each week we'll cover some of the topics shown here, guiding us towards happier, healthier and more fulfilling lives:</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/e/c/600_384836812.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/4/2/600_346474882.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/0/6/600_331348422.jpeg" /></p> <p>Our video or speaker each week is followed by a time of small group discussion, confidential sharing and support. You are welcome to visit or attend, without regard to your situation, separation/divorce timeline or faith background.</p> <p>While RSVPs are not required, it would be great if you'd click "<b>Yes</b>" if you're coming to this and future meetings. That makes our group more visible on Meetup, and encourages others to come.</p> <p><b><a href="http://www.meetup.com/LGC-Divorce-and-Relationship-Recovery/tellfriends">Click here</a></b> to have Meetup invite your friends to our group.</p> <p>You do not have to have a Meetup account, or be a member of our online group, to access this Meetup site. If you join, you can control how much e-mail you get from or through Meetup. Please review this<b> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/LGC-Divorce-and-Relationship-Recovery/pages/Managing_your_meetup_identity_and_privacy">newly-updated information</a> </b>on how to manage your privacy and security on meetup.com. </p> <p><br/>Unlike most of the year, we will <b>not</b> be offering child care during this series. Child care will resume in September.</p> <p>Finally, if you'd like to extend the benefits of Divorce and Relationship Recovery through new groups in other parts of the Bay Area, and eventually beyond, this would be a great time to <b><a href="http://www.divorceandrelationshiprecovery.org/donate">make a financial gift</a></b> to the Divorce and Relationship Recovery Network.</p>

V<p>The purpose of the meeting is to educate potential buyers/sellers/investors and 1031 exchanger's on  the real estate market, how important it is to make the right decision before you transact taking your personal requirements into account, as well as market forces and investment criteria. If you do consider your home as an investment, then make sure you understand this asset class and how future values will impact your returns.</p> <p><b>This meeting is not for other agents, brokers or wholesalers to come and present or discuss their deals</b>. There are plenty of other sites and forums that do that already. I will take you off the member list.</p> <p>I will not give any advice on "investment opportunities" outside my area of knowledge or state. I have had several people in the group who invested outside CA and may have trouble with that investment (ROI, and management). It also means that agents or investors who would like to "sell" their goods (real estate investment opportunities or books or tapes, etc), are not welcome in this meeting.</p> <p>This meeting is <b>specifically geared towards the consumers, owners and investors</b>, not the agents. Agents have plenty of other channels to market their services/goods or learn how to buy real estate from tapes or webmeetings. Allow me to inform you that I have gone through many of those myself without success. I am happy to share that with you.</p> <p>I am very protective of my potential clients, who have a chance in these meetings to "interview" me. I am looking forward to meeting with you and discuss your specific requirements.</p> <p>Antoine</p>

V<p><b>Occupy the Economy: Challenging Capitalism (City Lights Open Media) </b></p> <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Richard-D.-Wolff/e/B001H6PV5A/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1">Richard D. Wolff</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-author=David%20Barsamian&amp;search-alias=digital-text&amp;sort=relevancerank">David Barsamian</a> </p> <p>Today's economic crisis is capitalism's worst since the Great Depression. Millions have lost jobs, homes, and healthcare. Many with jobs watch pensions, benefits, and job security decline. While most live with increasing uncertainty, the system makes the very wealthy even richer. In eye-opening interviews with prominent economist Richard Wolff, David Barsamian probes the root causes of the current crisis, its unjust social costs, and what can and should be done to turn things around. While others blame corrupt bankers and unregulated speculators or the government or even the poor who borrowed, the authors show that the causes of the crisis run much deeper. They reach back to the 1970s when the capitalist system itself shifted, ending the century-old pattern of rising wages for Americans and thereby enabling the top 1% to become ultra-rich at the expense of the 99%. Since then, economic injustice has become chronic and further corrupted politics. Occupy's indignation with the whole system mobilizes a diverse range of Americans who seek basic change. <i>Occupying the Economy</i> not only clarifies and analyzes the crisis in US capitalism today, it also points toward solutions that can shape a far better future for all.</p> <p><b>Richard Wolff</b> is professor of economics at U. Mass, and visiting professor at the New School in New York City. He hosts a program on WBAI and is author of the hit book<i>Capitalism Hits the Fan</i>.</p> <p><b>David Barsamian</b> is director of Alternative Radio and author of many interview books, including <i>What We Say Goes</i> with Noam Chomsky.</p> <p> </p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/7/8/3/event_9850115.jpeg" /></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

V<p>Our general meetings occur every 2nd Tuesday, since March 2012. We get to know each other through informal discussions at our general meetings, and through local trips and adventures, sometimes arranged at our general meetings.</p> <p>Meeting format: 1) Quick intros ~ who you are and why you're here (2 minutes) 2) Travel questions &amp; tips ~ be brief so that everyone gets a chance to talk! 3) Help us to maintain one conversation between 7-8:00 pm--that is, no side conversations, please! After that we can socialize more informally.</p> <p>Come with your questions/suggestions or fun facts!</p> <p>We've been discussing destinations for bigger trips, comparing travel preferences, and sharing what's worked and not worked in our varied travel experiences--and, very importantly, developing friendships!</p> <p>This meeting is free, but please come prepared to buy at least a beverage ($2) so that we can continue to be welcome to take up space at this wonderful Palo Alto landmark cafe. Prolific Oven (downtown Palo Alto) has sweets and beverages only, in the evening, but you can bring a sandwich, if you are hungry, they won't mind. (Note that MeetUp website maps are not always accurate, it's a good idea to google directions on your own as well, if this is your first time. Meetup website seems to want to direct us to a different prolific oven; this one is in downtown Palo Alto - 550 Waverley Street, 94301).</p>

V<p>Come join PyLady Vanessa Shen as she talks about data visualization and how to get the most out of your data. </p> <p>In her words:</p> <p><i>As it becomes easier and easier for companies to collect huge amounts of information, they are realizing that they are sitting on terabytes of data whose insights they haven't explored. Data visualization allows us to detect patterns and relationships in data that would otherwise remain hidden.</i></p> <p><i>Though it's tempting to dive right in and start pumping out charts, there are concrete goals to consider before typing a single line of code. This presentation will cover goals, examples, resources, and tools so that next time you're curious about what's in the data, you'll know how to find out.</i></p> <p>Hope to see you there!</p>

V<p>TurnON: [turn{on}]  </p> <p><br/>verb (something that happens in the body)</p> <p>To raise the body heat, leaving the individual feeling as though they may perspire</p> <p>To feel tingles in random parts of the body, letting the individual know those parts are awake</p> <p>To encounter cheeks getting flushed, often leaving the individual feel seen</p> <p>To ignite, as to feel more alive and alert</p> <p>TurnON occurs from many different things. Maybe you saw someone you thought was cute. Maybe you had an inappropriate thought cross your mind.</p> <p>Maybe you saw something that inspired or even pissed you off. Many things/people/conversations leave us with this ignited feeling in our body. (yes, deep down we all like the feeling of TurnON!) You know it's TurnON because it ignites -- as though your body is giving you a cue, shouting out "I'm ALIVE in here"!</p> <p>TurnON leaves you feeling more alert, ignited and happy.</p> <p>At OneTaste, we believe TurnON is the ignition that leads to a more of what we really want in life. We believe it is the first step to knowing what is possible.</p> <p>So, we started an evening event designed specifically to give people the opportunity to feel TurnON in themselves. (p.s., it's totally PG-13) It's an evening where, through only talking, we begin to experience these exhilarating, normal, often ignored feelings -- referred to as TurnON. A room of people (cool, fun people) engage in honest, humorous, playful conversation around topics we mostly only consider having in our head.</p> <p>TurnOn leads to authenticity and authenticity leads to the kind of connection we hope for around the globe.</p> <p>The evening leaves you invigorated, happy and inspired. We are meant to live TurnedON.</p> <p><i><br/></i></p> <p><i>Details:</i><br/>Singles &amp; Couples Welcome<br/>This event is $10</p> <p> </p>

V<p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/6/6/600_379935462.jpeg" /></p> <p>Born in New Orleans, Donald Harrison grew up in a home environment saturated with the city\u2019s traditional music of brass bands, parades, modern jazz, r&amp;b, funk, classical, world ethnic, and dance music. His connection to New Orleans roots were deepened by his father, a Big Chief in the African and Native American influenced culture of New Orleans\u2019 Black Mardi Gras Indians. The culture is an offshoot culture of Congo Square, one of the only known places in North America where Africans openly participated in their culture in the 1700\u2019s and 1800\u2019s.</p> <p>Harrison recorded, \u201cQuantum Leap\u201d in 2012 which musicians and critics agree is a next step for jazz. With quantum jazz Harrison has opened up new areas for time, harmony, and melody. The record also melds cutting edge jazz with New Orleans funk - connecting the past with the present with jazz music that transcends boundaries.</p> <p>Harrison co-founded and became the artistic director for the Tipitina\u2019s Intern Program, and The New Jazz School where he along with a staff of his hand pick of seasoned veterans teach jazz theory, music and history to students 13 to 21. Taught and mentored the following musicians: trumpeter Christian Scott, trombonist/singer Trombone Shorty, rapper Notorius BIG, guitarist Josh Connelly in addition to saxophonists Louis Fouche, Chris Royal and Aaron Fletcher. His working groups have proven to be an incubator for jazz band leaders such as trumpeter Christian Scott, guitarist Mark Whitfield, pianist Cyrus Chestnut, bassists Christian McBride, and Esperanza Spaulding.</p> <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=YZ-bVDAl8xI" class="embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=YZ-bVDAl8xI</a></p> <p>Tickets are $23 and can be purchased on Yoshi's website (bellow)</p> <p><a href="http://www.yoshis.com/oakland/jazzclub/artist/show/4341" class="linkified">http://www.yoshis.com/oakland/jazzclub/artist/show/4341</a></p>

For each of the three learning and development subjects that we introduce and emphasize each month, we give you four different ways to learn it: We produce written learning guides, video learning guides, audio learning guide, and we cover the subjects as 15-to-20-minute mini-workshops inside of our 60-minute business-networking meetings.

V<p>This is a weekly Wednesday meet-up held in Sunnyvale.</p> <p>Due to the popularity of these local courts after 6:00 p.m., we'll start at 5:30 p.m. Please try to arrive on time to help us secure as many courts as possible.</p> <p>If you don't see us when you arrived at Mango courts during the busy USTA leagues seasons, look for us at our <b>alternative location at "Fremont High School", 1279 Sunnyvale Saratoga Rd., Sunnyvale, CA 94087</b></p> <p><a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl" class="linkified">https://maps.google.com/maps?hl</a>=...</p> <p><img src="http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/clear.gif" /></p> <p>Please be sure to RSVP, and kindly remember to update them in a timely manner should your plans changed, <b>preferably by noon. (Members with a history of no-shows or last minute cancellations will be removed from my future invitation and event lists).</b></p> <p>Should you plan to arrive later than the scheduled time, please mention it along with your RSVPs, but keep in mind that if you are more than a half hour late, you may lose your spot to a waiting list member. Also note that you may or may not be able to play beyond one hour depending on how busy the courts are.</p> <p>Members who are on the waiting list are welcome to come out and check to see if there are spaces available around 7:00 since we normally play until about 9 or 9:30. Priority will be applied according to the order of your RSVP.</p> <p>Rain cancel, unless the courts have had some time to dry.</p> <p>We appreciate everyone's contributions of tennis balls.</p> <p>Thanks! See you all on the courts!</p> <p><b>Mary is hosting</b></p> <p><img src="http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/smileys/smile.gif" /></p>

V<p>Startup Finance: Valuation</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/2/event_100045522.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>About:</b> Learn how to value a startup.</p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core. Valuation makes or breaks a company. It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job.

V<p>Once again, join fellow atheists to volunteer at Second Harvest's Cypress Center. We will be sorting food at the warehouse to prepare it for distribution.</p> <p>Closed-toe shoes and long pants are required. Everyone must be at least 14 years old. Anyone 14-17 must be accompanied by a parent. Second Harvest suggests that volunteers consider bringing a donation of non-perishable foods. High-protein items like peanut butter and tuna are preferable along with canned meals like stew or soup. Learn more about Second Harvest at <a href="http://www.shfb.org" class="linkified">http://www.shfb.org</a>.</p>

V<p>For the fourth year in a row Sustainable Lafayette will be hosting a summer film series at the Lafayette Library &amp; Learning Center that will feature three recently released documentaries on weekday evenings. A $10.00 donation is requested for adults $5.00 for students. Light snacks and coffee will be provided. Check our website, sustainablelafayette.org, for more details.</p> <p><br/>The 3rd film is Watershed on Wednesday, August 13, @ 6:30 pm</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/f/c/4/600_380029092.jpeg" /></p> <p>Executive produced &amp; narrated by Robert Redford</p> <p>Produced by the Redford Center and Kontent Films</p> <p>Executive Produced and Narrated by Robert Redford and Directed by award-winning filmmaker, Mark Decena, WATERSHED tells the story of the threats to the once-mighty Colorado River and offers solutions for the future of the American West.</p> <p>As the most dammed, dibbed, and diverted river in the world struggles to support thirty million people and the peace-keeping agreement known as the Colorado River Pact reaches its limits, WATERSHED introduces hope.</p> <p>Can we meet the needs of a growing population in the face of rising temperatures and lower rainfall in an already arid land? Can we find harmony amongst the competing interests of cities, agriculture, industry, recreation, wildlife, and indigenous communities with rights to the water?</p> <p><a href="http://riverredfilm.com/stage_ws/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/River2.png">&lt;/a&gt;Sweeping through seven U.S. and two Mexican states, the Colorado River is a lifeline to expanding populations and booming urban centers that demand water for drinking, sanitation and energy generation. And with 70% of the rivers\u2019 water supporting agriculture, the river already runs dry before it reaches its natural end at the Gulf of California. Unless action is taken, the river will continue its retreat \u2013 a potentially catastrophic scenario for the millions who depend on it.</p> <p>In WATERSHED, we meet Jeff Ehlert, a fly fishing guide in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado rancher Dan James, Delta restoration worker Edith Santiago, Navajo Council member Glojean Todacheene, Rifle Colorado Mayor Keith Lambert, Los Angeles native Jimmy Lizama and a group of Outward Bound teens rafting down the Colorado River as they all reflect a compelling new water ethic\u2014one that illuminates how letting go of the ways of old can lead to a path of coexisting with enough for all.</p> <p>The Redford Center created WATERSHED as a inspirational social action tool for people who want to engage. Promoting personal water conservation pledges of 5% \u2013 symbolic of the small amount of the rivers\u2019 flow required to reconnect the river to its delta \u2013 and garnering donations to help purchase the water rights necessary to restore the connectivity, WATERSHED is a central tool in a larger grassroots effort focused on saving the Colorado River and supporting the communities throughout the river basin.</p> <p>Presented by the Redford Center</p> <p>A Production of the Redford Center and Kontent Films</p> <p>Writer / Director: Mark Decena</p> <p>Executive Producers: Robert Redford, Teri Heyman, Lee Bycel</p> <p>Producers: James Redford, Jill Tidman</p> <p>Producer / Post Production Supervisor: Renata Foucré</p> <p>Co-producer: Scott Compton</p> <p>Director of Photography: John Behrens</p> <p>Editor: Matt Notaro</p> <p>Story Editors: John Dilley, Forrest Pound</p> <p>Assistant Editors: Joanna Hidalgo, Luke Shock</p> <p>Editorial House: Remedy Editorial</p> <p>Additional Photography: Fearghal ODea, Forrest Pound, Renata Foucré, Mark Decena</p> <p>Associate Producers: Forrest Pound, Tye Davis</p> <p>Content Advisor: Barry Nelson, NRDC</p> <p>Distribution Partners: NRDC, McSweeney\u2019s, Save The Colorado and Sonoran Institute</p> <p>Associate Story Developers: Jordan Bass, Ira Chute, Chris Ying, Emily Doe</p> <p>Publicity, Marketing and Distribution Consultant: Diana Iles Parker</p> <p><br/><img src="http://riverredfilm.com/stage_ws/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/River2.png" /></p> <p><a href="http://youtu.be/3mcHrzOImoY" class="embedded">http://youtu.be/3mcHrzOImoY</a></p> <p>Meeting time:  6:15pm</p> <p>Showtime: 6:30pm</p> <p>Location:  Community Hall at the Lafayette Library</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/7/0/600_379959792.jpeg" /></p> <p>Should you have a problem finding us before or after the meetup, send us a mobile text with your location to [masked] (number to be used only during event hours)</p> <p>If you need or can provide a carpool, please indicate it in your RSVP and feel free to arrange it using the comment box below.</p> <p>Questions?

V<p>Startup Finance: Valuation</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/2/event_100045522.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>About:</b> Learn how to value a startup.</p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core. Valuation makes or breaks a company. It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job.

V<p>This is an opportunity to get expert feedback on your photography, to improve your work, and learn professional tips and tricks. Gain insight into your own photography, learn from the work of others, and benefit from the opportunity to network with a small group of fellow photographers.</p> <p><b>What We Do</b></p> <p>We get together monthly at a photography studio in San Francisco, where Photojournalist and Photographer Khaled Sayed will perform a live interactive critique of up to 10 photographs submitted in advance by attendees. </p> <p>Everyone is encouraged to join us at a local coffee shop after the critique session for more intimate discussion of images and portfolios brought in by attendees.</p> <p><br/>Attendance is limited to no more than 20 photographers each month and no more than 10 photographs in each critique, to provide focus and attention. </p> <p><b>How To Participate</b></p> <p><a href="http://sfphotographers.tumblr.com/submit">Submit your photographs</a> to the group's public gallery on Tumblr no fewer than five days before the meeting for the opportunity to have your work published on the group's site, and have them be part of the live critique. Each attendee may submit up to three photographs for consideration for each meeting. The moderator will choose the pictures to be discussed before the event, but not all photos submitted will be included in the discussion, or added to the group site.</p> <p><br/>Please bring your own work to share, or just come to be inspired by your fellow photographers. Everyone is encouraged to bring your portfolio with you in print, on your tablet, or on your own notebook to share with others at a local coffee shop after the presentation.</p> <p>We do ask attendees for a donation of $5.00 at each meeting to help cover the cost of maintaining the space and the equipment. If you want to pay in advance, or make a different donation, please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/photography-critique-and-portfolio-review-tickets-12055842349">visit our Eventbrite page</a>.</p>

V<p>4v4 pickup (4 simultaneous games if there are enough folks). First session begins at 7pm. Each session is one hour long. Teams are capped at 5 per side to ensure playing time for folks. Substitutions are enforced by the facilitator every 2 minutes so playing time is even spread evenly and everyone can just focus on having fun playing rather than worry about who's going to come out to make room for them. :)</p> <p>The vibe is laid back and fun. Like all SoccerFours sessions, teams are made up at the field, and scores aren't kept. There are no leagues. It's just organized pickup soccer run by a facilitator. $7/person for the session. RSVP here and bring cash to the field or sign up on our main site if you'd like. (If the slots here are full, try our main site to see if there are any left.)</p> <p>Let's have some fun! :)</p>

V<p>I know it's been awhile, but this one's for you, East-Bay-ers!</p> <p>Although I'm not super familiar with the East Bay, I know that's where many awesome people live -- people who can't always make it into the city for karaoke. That being said, I am excited to travel to a new place and meet new people, and hope that many of you will be able to join me at Nick's Lounge (close to the Ashby BART station, which is an added bonus)!</p> <p>If you love singing, getting your drink on, or just enjoy watching others sing, please join me in Berkeley! I look forward to seeing old friends and making new ones!</p> <p>Nick's Lounge<br/><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/nicks-lounge-berkeley" class="linkified">http://www.yelp.com/biz/nicks-lounge-berkeley</a><br/><a href="http://www.nickslounge.com/" class="linkified">http://www.nickslounge.com/</a></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a&lt;Hosted with the San Francisco Random Adventurers 20s-30s group&gt;</p>

V<p>Dubbed \u201ca wonderfully engaging P.I.\u201d (<i>The Times, </i>London), Tarquin Hall\u2019s irresistible protagonist Vish Puri has become an international favorite through a series that \u201csplendidly evokes the color and bustle of Delhi and the tang of contemporary India\u201d (<i>Seattle Times</i>). Now the gormandizing, spectacularly mustachioed sleuth finds himself facing down his greatest fears in an explosive case involving the Indian and Pakistani mafias. </p> <p>When the elderly father of a top Pakistani cricketer playing in a new multimillion-dollar cricket league dies frothing at the mouth during a post-match dinner, it\u2019s not a simple case of Delhi Belly. His butter chicken has been poisoned. To solve the case, Puri must penetrate the region\u2019s organized crime, following a trail that leads deep into Pakistan\u2014the country in which many members of the P.I.\u2019s family were massacred during the 1947 partition of India. The last piece of the puzzle, however, turns up closer to home when Puri learns of the one person who can identify the killer. Unfortunately it is the one person in the world with whom he has sworn never to work: his Mummy-ji. </p> <p>With riotously entertaining prose, a boisterous cast of characters, and a pitch-perfect sense of place, Tarquin Hall has crafted a gripping whodunit that takes us deep into Indian history and society. He brings a hugely appealing culture to life with all its sights, sounds, smells, foods, and complexity. As the title implies, <i>The Case of the Deadly Butter Chicken </i>is a succulent read by a writer at the top of his game.</p>

V<p>THE RUN:<br/>We're due (some might say overdue) for an <i>all</i> flat run! And an out-and-back segment on the Embarcadero makes it easy to shorten or extend to your desired distance! Turn around at Broadway for about 4.25 miles. Near the start we'll pass <a href="http://yerbabuenagardens.com/photo-tour/">Yerba Buena Gardens</a> on the way to <a href="http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/ballpark/information/">AT&amp;T Park</a> where the Giants host the White Sox earlier in the day.<br/>Click <a href="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/a/a/highres_371174762.jpeg">here</a> for the printable full-size map.</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/9/a/a/600_371174762.jpeg" /></p> <p>THE BAR:<br/>This week's bar was suggested by <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SF-Fun-Run/members/9962847/">Beverly</a>! This brewery is big like the <a href="http://www.7x7.com/eat-drink/whats-tap-gordon-biersch-after-its-closure">old Gordon Biersch</a>--two stories with pool upstairs. The bar stays open 'til last call after the kitchen closes at 10pm.<br/>Drinks: full bar with <a href="http://thirstybear.com/brewery">house-brewed organic beers</a>, also available to-go in growlers!<br/>Payment: cash, credit cards<br/>Serves food: until 10pm, <a href="http://thirstybear.com/menu">menu link</a><br/>Allows outside food: no</p> <p>Still have questions? Check the <a href="http://www.sffunrun.com/about/">FAQ</a>, then ask away! <b>#1 most frequent question:</b> Is there somewhere to store my stuff during the run? No. Store your ID and beer money in your pocket. Don't bring any other "stuff."</p>

V<p>Recently, Joyent published results of using the <a href="http://labs.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-cloud-serving-benchmark/">YCSB benchmark</a> with MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Postgres. The results of the benchmarks can be found  <a href="http://www.joyent.com/products/compute-service/benchmarks">here</a>. To discuss these benchmark results, Joyent is planning a meet-up at the Joyent office in San Francisco on the evening of July 9th. During this meet-up, we'll do some active benchmarking using YCSB and one or two of the target benchmarks (MongoDB, etc.). Doing this will confirm that the benchmark tests what it says it tests, and will help in understanding the results. In active benchmarking, performance is analyzed while the benchmark is running. This will use tools available on SmartOS (DTrace, iostat, mpstat, etc.). We'll also examine some issues we have run into, and how we have solved those issues.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/benchmarking-meetup-tickets-11864720699">Click here to register for this meetup</a>.</p> <p>Speakers: <br/><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/max-bruning/0/337/180">Max Bruning</a>, Joyent</p> <p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/vdrndarski">Vladimir Drndarski</a>, ThotSpot</p>

V<p>4v4 pickup (4 simultaneous games if there are enough folks). Second session begins at 8pm. Each session is one hour long. Teams are capped at 5 per side to ensure playing time for folks. Substitutions are enforced by the facilitator every 2 minutes so playing time is even spread evenly and everyone can just focus on having fun playing rather than worry about who's going to come out to make room for them. :)</p> <p>The vibe is laid back and fun. Like all SoccerFours sessions, teams are made up at the field, and scores aren't kept. There are no leagues. It's just organized pickup soccer run by a facilitator. $6/person for the session. RSVP here and bring cash to the field or sign up on our main site if you'd like. (If the slots here are full, try our main site to see if there are any left.)</p> <p>Let's have some fun! :)</p>

We welcome anyone to attend a GoRampUp! meeting, once, for free as our guest, so you can learn what the innovative GoRampUp! business-networking experience is all about. Note, we are not able to give you a free meeting at more than one of our many locations.</p> <p>YOU MUST obtain a free-access GoRampUp! Golden ticket by registering for a specific meeting at<a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar/"><a href="http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/" class="linkified">http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/</a></a>. This ticket must be presented at your complimentary meeting for you to gain admittance. Without this ticket you will, unfortunately, be declined access to our innovative and exclusive business-networking meeting. WITH a GoRampUp! Golden Ticket, you will be welcomed with open arms!</p> <p>It can be too difficult to attract new clients. We help you fix that! We're a business-impact community. We're informal and fun, yet, by design, we're extremely effective!</p> <p>We help people who work for a living to get a much greater payoff from working. We do this in three specific ways under our three CoreSuccess Platforms: 1) We help you move toward mastery with business-networking, 2) We help you move toward mastery with business performance, and, 3) We help you move toward mastery with personal development.</p> <p>How do we deliver on this promise to our community members? Each month we conduct dozens of business-networking meetings in more than a dozen cities in the SF Bay Area. A member may attend all of our "OpenConnect" business-networking meetings. And our members are welcome and encouraged to attend any and all of these meetings and locations.</p> <p>Each month we introduce and emphasize a learning and development subject under each of our three CoreSuccess Platforms. For each of the three learning and development subjects that we introduce and emphasize each month, we give you four different ways to learn it: We produce written learning guides, video learning guides, audio learning guide, and we cover the subjects as 15-to-20-minute mini-workshops inside of our 60-minute business-networking meetings. There's no registration or initiation fee to join. Membership in GoRampUp! is month to month. You enroll when you like, even mid-month, and you depart when you like.</p> <p>Be sure to see our website to learn about <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/growrampup">our generous enrollment incentives</a></p> <p>Also, be sure to learn about our <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/norisk">100-Satisfaction Money-Back Guarantee</a></p> <p>Would you care to come to this meeting, at no cost, to see if there\u2019s business-value for you?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">Free-Meeting Guest-RSVP and Golden Ticket Request</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">View complete meeting details</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/invite">Invite a Buddy to join you</a></p> <p>One last thing: You REALLY should check out actual testimonial videos by our members: <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/why">See them here</a></p> <p>This page was created to produce awareness of our event.

V<p><b><i>Jafar Husain is a Technical Lead at Netflix</i></b>, with over 16 years of experience in the industry. He's currently a member of the TC39, the Javascript standards body designing the next version of JS. He specializes in building web servers and clients using functional reactive programming, and was the first user of the Reactive Extensions Framework. He's also responsible for "Falkor", a RESTful data access framework that powers most Netflix clients. A highly-rated speaker, he has spoken about reactive programming at YOW!, QCon, CodeMesh, and given Channel 9 interviews on the subject. He has also authored interactive training software to help developers learn about functional reactive programming.</p> <p><b>What does a mouse drag event have in common with an Array of numbers?</b><br/>     The answer to this question may surprise you: they are both collections. This key insight holds the key to dramatically simplifying asynchronous programming in Javascript. In this talk you will learn how you can use the familiar Javascript Array methods to create surprisingly expressive asynchronous programs. Using just a few functions, you will learn how to do the following:<br/>     * Declaratively build complex events out of simple events (ex. drag n' drop)<br/>     * Coordinate and sequence multiple Ajax requests<br/>     * Reactively update UI's in response to data changes<br/>     * Eliminate memory leaks caused by neglecting to unsubscribe from events<br/>     * Gracefully propagate and handle asynchronous exceptions</p> <p><br/>      \u000a\u000aIn this talk we'll be exploring the Reactive Extensions (Rx) library (<a href="https://rx.codeplex.com/" class="linkified">https://rx.codeplex.com/</a>) which allows us to treat events as collections. You'll learn about how Netflix uses Rx on the client and the server, allowing us to build end-to-end reactive systems. We'll also contrast Rx with Promises, another popular approach to building asynchronous programs in Javascript.   </p> <p><br/>Please come and join us for a fun, informational evening where you can hear Jafar speak as well as meet other interesting people.</p> <p>Snacks and beverages will be served. Please RSVP so we have an accurate headcount.</p> <p>See you there!</p> <p>============================</p> <p>Note on Logistics:</p> <p><b>Meet Up is at</b>: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2Jxla"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2Jxla" class="linkified">https://goo.gl/maps/2Jxla</a></a></p> <p><br/>4655 Great America Parkway, Harvest Training Room, Santa Clara, CA 95054</p> <p><br/>  Harvest Training Room is in the ground floor of the building.</p>

V<p>Nowadays, most web developers are using "MVC" concepts and frameworks to organize the JS that powers their website and better separate the presentation from the data.</p> <p>In this evening workshop, we'll give an overview of MVC frameworks and spend most of our time actually getting our hands dirty using MVC concepts. We'll give an overview of popular frameworks, like Backbone, but we will not focus on any framework in particular.</p> <p>As a prerequisite, you should be fairly familiar with JS, jQuery, AJAX, and OO, either by attending our workshops or learning elsewhere. Bring a laptop, a charger, and a smile.</p> <p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> for the great space.</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you'd like to attend but cannot afford the cost, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHRPTms0blNlTlo3cUpySFJENzBEdWc6MQ">request a GDI scholarship</a>.</p> <p>Please note that we cannot issue refunds, since there's an overhead to issuing refunds via Meetup.com and we already offer the workshops at such a low-cost. We put proceeds into the chapter fund, which we use as our scholarship fund.</p>

V<p>I know its a Thursday, but what the heck lets see whose wants to come and watch an amazing classic movie where we also get to sing and dance our way through the night if we choose too. The Grease Sing-a-Long is being held at the Vine in Livermore. If you don't have a chance to grab dinner first don't worry, you will find they serve a wide variety of beer, wine, and other beverages as well as food brought to you by Alehouse and Zephyr Bar and Grill and regular movie concessions. I expect the theater may be busy so I am setting the meet up time for 30 minutes prior to the start of the movie.</p>

V<p><b>Experience Reiki</b> Reiki can help you to feel better! Reiki is a healing energy that flows in all of us This Meetup Group is Organized and Facilitated by four Reiki Masters; Jennifer, Ted, Rebecca and Jeff. They have made it possible for you to give and receive Reiki without having had the attunements. You do not want to miss this event. Reiki is a unique healing experience, rediscovered in Japan in the late 19th century but originally dating back at least to the days of the The Second Temple and of Jesus. This is not a structured training, but an opportunity for all to experience Reiki and for trained Reiki practitioners to practice by enjoying a Reiki exchange. <b> We start at 7:00 and we are usually complete by 9:00</b> $10.00 Suggested Donation&lt;/p&gt;</p>

V<p><b>UPDATE: This Meetup is now closed to newcomers as tickets for the event have now sold out.  Only add yourself on this meet up if you already bought a ticket for yourself and no other reason.</b></p> <p>This is the second attempt for this meet up due to another show date being arranged by James Rolfe for San Francisco.  I must ask that you only RSVP for this meet up if you buy your ticket right away before they sell out, and they will quickly.</p> <p>TICKETS ON SALE HERE:<br/><a href="https://tickets.landmarktheatres.com/(S(ly3hnikb2gj3qhkq5whhu0rt))/Ticketing.aspx?TheatreID=226&amp;MovieID=15735&amp;ShowDate=8/14/2014&amp;ScheduleID=58636"><a href="https://tickets.landmarktheatres.com/(S(ly3hnikb2gj3qhkq5whhu0rt))/Ticketing.aspx?TheatreID=226&amp;MovieID=15735&amp;ShowDate=8/14/2014&amp;ScheduleID=58636" class="linkified">https://tickets.landmarktheatres.com/(S(ly3hnikb2gj3qhkq5whhu0rt))/Ticketing.aspx?TheatreID=226&amp;MovieID=15735&amp;ShowDate=8/14/2014&amp;ScheduleID=58636</a></a></p> <p>Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie is an independent movie based on the Web Series known as The Angry Video Game Nerd (Formerly The Angry Nintendo Nerd) which is a Video Game based comedy series where The Nerd (Played by Filmmaker and Actor, James Rolfe) plays and reviews bad video games which fills him with foul mouthed anger and rage, and at many times during these reviews, he faces many adventures and meets many characters.</p> <p>This movie is a on a larger scale where The Nerd goes on an adventure to unearth the truth about the so called worst game of all time, E.T. for the Atari 2600 which he has a huge phobia of.  James Rolfe, the creator, director, writer, and actor of The Nerd has insisted upon more practical effects over CGI, so it will have a B Movie feel to it, but it's also part of what James is going for.</p> <p>\u000a\u000aPlease keep in mind that this movie contains a lot of foul language and humor, so this is not advised for those under 18.</p>

V<p>The book selected for the month of August is: The City and the City by China Mieville. Tentatively  venue for now is Fuzio at Embarcadero. I will update you if any changes.  Meeting as always is schedule for 7pm  but you may join us for Happy Hour before that (and maybe we can discuss Ulysses ).  See you there! :) </p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/0/e/600_386703342.jpeg" /></p> <p>The City and the Cityby </p> <p><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/33918.China_Mi_ville">China Miéville</a></p> <p>Inspector Tyador Borlú of the Extreme Crime Squad finds deadly conspiracies beneath a seemingly routine murder. From the decaying Beszel, he joins detective Qussim Dhatt in rich vibrant Ul Qoma, and both are enmeshed in a sordid underworld. Rabid nationalists are intent on destroying their neighboring city, and unificationists dream of dissolving the two into one.</p>

V<p>Tea and Tarot is our opportunity to chat generally about tarot and metaphysics. I  This is an evening meant to be a potpourri of the different inquiries the group is making into metaphysics these days. If you have an interest that you are currently investigating, bring it along and give a little "show and tell". If you are a novice, this is a great time to ask questions about things that are confusing you. Come along for a great conversation with like minded people.</p> <p>As always, a $5.00 contribution is appreciated to cover the costs of the group. No one is turned away for lack of funds, however.</p>

V<p>I think it is natural for villagers with children of the same age to meetup together. Please RSVP and introduce yourselves to each other. I have to admit that I didn't leave the house much for the first year. But, I think if you guys can meet together with blankets and strollers under some shade, it would be a great break from the isolation of having a baby.</p>

V<p>Let's meet in our home for cookie baking. I will provide safe cookie cutters and healthy decorating like nuts, raisins and shredded coconut. Let's make cute cookies with our little ones and have tea party and coffee with them afterwards. Kids can also enjoy a playtime after they are done making and eating the cookies :) We will need a healthy cookie dough with less sugar for all of us. Who can make it? Kids can take the cookies they made to their dads too!</p>

V<p>The For six years now, Octopretzel has been delighting young Bay Area audiences with their colorful and inspired performances. Their shows feature handmade puppets, bubbles of all sizes, and at times, hula-hooping Kindergarteners. They have been known to inspire spontaneous kiddie mosh-pits, while still maintaining focus and interactive participation. Their songwriting presents imagery of things such as spinning tops, roly polies and whimsical imaginary creatures. From unique interpretations of traditional folk classics to fun and catchy originals, this is music that parents love and has kids asking for more!</p> <p>$3 per ticket, you need only buy as many tickets as you need seats (lap children are free)</p>

V<p>Hello Villagers!</p> <p>We've had a great response in the first week of our existence.!!</p> <p>I'm new to being the organizer of a Meetup. I want to welcome everyone to the group and value your input. I'd love for you to invite other villagers from your preschool or other playgroups. We would love to cross post with other Meetup groups. </p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aThere are lots of summer events in the Bay Area. While I cannot host events centered around each festival/event, I have posted some of our favorite ones on the calendar with "yellow post-it's". Please let me know if you would like to host a meetup in your neighborhood. I'm attempting to put things on the calendar in Sunnyvale and Fremont. </p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aWe will be posting photos on the site. We usually have one person documenting things, but sometimes we are just having too much fun to take any pics! If you would not like your child or yourself to be posted in any photos, please let us know. </p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aPlease keep your RSVPs current as a courtesy to your event hosts. </p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aTo help defray the website's costs and material fees, please pay $2 at the next event you attend. </p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aLastly, please RSVP to this event so that I know you have read this posting. Thanks,</p> <p><br/>Elaine</p>

We welcome anyone to attend a GoRampUp! meeting, once, for free as our guest, so you can learn what the innovative GoRampUp! business-networking experience is all about. Note, we are not able to give you a free meeting at more than one of our many locations.</p> <p>YOU MUST obtain a free-access GoRampUp! Golden ticket by registering for a specific meeting at<a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar/"><a href="http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/" class="linkified">http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/</a></a>. This ticket must be presented at your complimentary meeting for you to gain admittance. Without this ticket you will, unfortunately, be declined access to our innovative and exclusive business-networking meeting. WITH a GoRampUp! Golden Ticket, you will be welcomed with open arms!</p> <p>It can be too difficult to attract new clients. We help you fix that! We're a business-impact community. We're informal and fun, yet, by design, we're extremely effective!</p> <p>We help people who work for a living to get a much greater payoff from working. We do this in three specific ways under our three CoreSuccess Platforms: 1) We help you move toward mastery with business-networking, 2) We help you move toward mastery with business performance, and, 3) We help you move toward mastery with personal development.</p> <p>How do we deliver on this promise to our community members? Each month we conduct dozens of business-networking meetings in more than a dozen cities in the SF Bay Area. A member may attend all of our "OpenConnect" business-networking meetings. And our members are welcome and encouraged to attend any and all of these meetings and locations.</p> <p>Each month we introduce and emphasize a learning and development subject under each of our three CoreSuccess Platforms. For each of the three learning and development subjects that we introduce and emphasize each month, we give you four different ways to learn it: We produce written learning guides, video learning guides, audio learning guide, and we cover the subjects as 15-to-20-minute mini-workshops inside of our 60-minute business-networking meetings. There's no registration or initiation fee to join. Membership in GoRampUp! is month to month. You enroll when you like, even mid-month, and you depart when you like.</p> <p>Be sure to see our website to learn about <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/growrampup">our generous enrollment incentives</a></p> <p>Also, be sure to learn about our <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/norisk">100-Satisfaction Money-Back Guarantee</a></p> <p>Would you care to come to this meeting, at no cost, to see if there\u2019s business-value for you?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">Free-Meeting Guest-RSVP and Golden Ticket Request</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">View complete meeting details</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/invite">Invite a Buddy to join you</a></p> <p>One last thing: You REALLY should check out actual testimonial videos by our members: <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/why">See them here</a></p> <p>This page was created to produce awareness of our event.

V<p>Wreck Room on California St. is amazing! If you haven't been, it's an absolute must! And if you have already been already countless times, you can attest to this.</p> <p>Wreck Room knows we're coming and will be packing the place. I've joined up with the super fun social sporting league Zog Sports and they will be promoting this to their members as well and co-sponsoring this!</p> <p>Thus, turnout is going to be excellent and this will be a sweet way to get your Friday night started, having a few cocktails (their prices are very appreciated) and playing some fun games.</p> <p>Their list of games include: skee ball, punching bag game, basketball shooting game, pool, shuffleboard, and darts.... and we'll see if we can add anything else to that mix.</p> <p>Bring friends and come on out. Free event :)</p>

V<p>Hello, boys and girls,</p> <p>Ready for some summer fun? Let's get together for an evening of merriment, relaxation and enjoyment at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, for Eddie Money's concert on Friday, August 15, at 6 PM. The Friday night summer concerts are *free*.</p> <p>***** PICTURE THIS...aahhh:</p> <p>Imagine sitting in your comfortable beach chair, relaxed, enjoying a cold drink, listening to great music, while the evening breeze from the ocean cools the summer air, and when evening falls, the twinkly lights reflect on the ocean. All that and great company [that would be us :) ]. What could be better. You can even dance to the fantastic beat of Eddy Money and his band if the mood strikes you. Nice, huh...so let's do it!</p> <p>***** GETTING A SPOT TO SIT:</p> <p>To get a piece of beach real estate to park our chairs, we need to be at the beach at least one hour ahead, so by 5 PM - and that might be cutting it a bit close. These concerts are well-attended and the beach fills up quickly, especially in the center, close to the band stand.</p> <p>***** FOOD:</p> <p>Since 6 PM is dinner time, you can pick up a sandwich or a pizza in Santa Cruz, on the way to the Boardwalk, or bring your food from home, and enjoy it on the beach.</p> <p>Togo's is at 902 Ocean St., Santa Cruz, [masked] (according to the Internet, but you should double check, just in case);</p> <p>Domino's is at 2391 Mission St., Santa Cruz, [masked] (according to the Internet, but you should double check, just in case);</p> <p>OR check the Internet for any other food you might prefer.</p> <p>***** CARPOOLING (for those who wish to carpool):</p> <p>It is your sole responsibility to arrange for your carpool.</p> <p>Meet at 3:45 PM. Traffic is heavy on Fridays, so this should allow enough time to get to Santa Cruz, pick up some food, park, and find a spot to sit on the beach.</p> <p>Carpooling location/s: Because carpooling arrangements are your sole responsibility, you are free to park wherever you and the other carpoolers in your carpooling group have agreed to do so.</p> <p>The North Side Municipal Parking Lot, in Los Gatos is a popular carpooling location for groups going to Santa Cruz. I am mentioning this here as one option, for your convenience, in case that you were not aware of this parking lot.</p> <p>Directions to North Side Municipal Parking Lot: on Highway 17 heading South, take the Los Gatos/Saratoga Road (Highway 9) exit (20B). Bear right and go past the first traffic light, which is University Ave. Turn right into the first driveway into the North Side Municipal Parking Lot. The lot is on the right in the middle of the block past University Ave., but before N. Santa Cruz Ave. It is by Chase Bank, which is at 400 N. Santa Cruz Ave. (Please double check directions, as this information is from the Internet and I cannot vouch for its accuracy).</p> <p>***** PARKING:</p> <p>According to the Boardwalk's web site, parking lot fees are $12 on weekdays.</p> <p>ALRIGHTY, THEN, LET'S GO HAVE SOME SUMMER FUN. :)</p> <p>----------&gt; IMPORTANT NOTE AND DISCLAIMER: The function of the organizer/s and event host/s for this event is only to schedule the event on the calendar and to write a description of the event. Joining this event is entirely voluntary on your part. It is your sole responsibility, as part of signing up for this event, to make a reasonable effort to independently investigate the risks, dangers, and hazards associated with the activities involved in participating in this event. You agree to freely accept and fully assume all such risks, dangers and hazards, and further agree to release and discharge the Organizer/s, Assistant Organizer/s and the Event Host/s of the "Bay Area Single Boomers Social" Meetup group from any and all liability arising from your participation in this group activity. Each person who signs up for an event/meetup/or outing is responsible for his or her own safety.</p> <p>It is your sole responsibility to arrange for your carpool. It is important that you be careful who you carpool with and exercise common sense and caution. It is NOT a good idea, especially for women, to carpool with people that you don't know or don't know well.</p> <p>Please exercise common sense, good judgement and appropriate safety conduct.</p>

V<p>Join us in scenic Moss Beach for a concert in an intimate listening room, in an evening highlighting music and art inspired by our wine country and coast. The show blends the original guitar music of Brian Gore with projected illustrations, animations and one of a kind live digital drawing by Bill Russell, to tell 'stories without words' about our fabled region. Watch a short video of what we do (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp5sLTKPYWs">click here</a>).   The audience chooses a subject from the inspiring local environs of Half Moon Bay to be drawn live in a special finale segment of the show.  Please help us pick which subject to draw in advance at our website (<a href="http://winecountrytales.com/performances/">click here</a>). </p> <p>This is a one-of-a-kind experience in a stunningly beautiful location. Participants will have a chance to mingle, drink and dine before the show begins. Dinner, drink and show is provided for an all-inclusive price of $30. Dinner and drinks starts at 6:00pm  Show at 7:00pm.</p> <p><b>For tickets contact: Sharon via [masked] </b><b> or call [masked] .

V<p>Get psyched to put all the knowledge we've been gaining from these outstanding sessions to use....coming this summer, save the date for the first ever Adventure Design Group <i>ADVENTURE JAM</i>!</p> <p>This'll work much like a traditional game jam, but with a focus on live immersive experiences that bridge games, tech, theater, physical environments, and public space.</p> <p>We'll get together, split into semi-random 3-5 person groups with a nice spread of skills, and announce a theme for the jam. From that point through the next 48 hours, you'll crunch like crazy to build the most amazing experience you can! Then we'll share, vote on awards, and either go out for drinks or collapse in a heap, depending on how much sleep we've had.</p> <p>So start taking notes and stockpiling ideas, I think some great projects and newly forged collaborations could come from this weekend of creative intensity!</p> <p><b>Location:</b> South Park (to be shared with attendees)</p> <p><b>Snacks:</b> There will be a small attendance fee (probably $10) to cover food and snacks during the jam so we stay energized. To be confirmed closer to event.</p> <p><b>Schedule:</b><br/>- Friday, 6pm: Gather and socialize <i>(Be on time!!)</i><br/>- Friday, 6:30pm: Reveal theme<br/>- Friday, 7:30pm: Present pitches, shuffle teams if necessary<br/>- Friday-Sunday: Make your experiences!<br/>- Sunday, 4pm: Present your work!<br/>- Sunday, 5pm: Awards!</p>

V<p>Let's get together to discuss the first 3 chapters in Brene Brown's "Daring Greatly: : How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead"</p> <p>If you have not heard of Brene, check out her TED talk link below: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability.html" class="linkified">http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability.html</a></p> <p>This book is available at most libraries and on Amazon at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms-ebook/dp/B007P7HRS4/" class="linkified">http://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms-ebook/dp/B007P7HRS4/</a></p> <p>There is a reading guide at <a href="http://files.meetup.com/1459183/Daring-Greatly-Reading-Guide.pdf" class="linkified">http://files.meetup.com/1459183/Daring-Greatly-Reading-Guide.pdf</a> if you like reading guides to guide your discussion!</p> <p>In Daring Greatly, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown\u2019s many fans have been waiting for, Daring Greatly will spark a new spirit of truth\u2014and trust\u2014in our organizations, families, schools, and communities.</p>

V<p><b><i>Children's Fairyland</i></b> is having a benefit on August 15th (Friday) from 7-10pm and it's for GROWN-UP'S ONLY! This is what call the Happiest of Hours!  Why?  Because... 1) Happy Hour 2) Beer at Fairlyland 3) Fairlyland is kid free 4) you can feel good because it's a benefit event for an Oakland landmark! This event sells out and tickets go on sale ($25) on July 12th. Break out your fairy wings and Batman capes!</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/a/c/600_382463212.jpeg" /></p> <p><a href="http://oaklandish.com/oakblog/save-the-date-fairyland-for-grownups/"><a href="http://oaklandish.com/oakblog/save-the-date-fairyland-for-grownups/" class="linkified">http://oaklandish.com/oakblog/save-the-date-fairyland-for-grownups/</a></a></p> <p>\u000a\u000aFrom the Website:</p> <p>During daylight hours, Fairyland is off-limits to grown-ups.

V<p>Hi!  I have a regular game night at my house on third Fridays.  Recent games played usually include more social games such as Flux, Apples to Apples, Blokus, In a Pickle, Loaded Questions, etc.  But we could certainly have a more strategy type game if we get enough people interested.  I usually make some food like chili or lasagna. It will be kid friendly as I have a nearly 6 year old who would love to have some kids to play with (XBOX, Wii?). Bring snacks to share.  Warning to allergy sufferers - we have a cat. She will mostly be in hiding.  It might be helpful to have a couple more folding chairs if we get big crowd.  I have about six people (not on Meetup) who regularly show up too.</p> <p>Hope to see some of you here!    ~Elise</p>

Rahim is a healer, teacher, and Muqaddam Murabbi Ruhi in the Shadhiliyya Sufi. He leads workshops all over the country and loves to help people heal their hearts and<br/>come closer back to God.</p> <p>A donation of $10, $20, or whatever you can give would be appreciated; no one turned away for lack of funds.</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/c/a/d/600_39708301.jpeg" /></p>

V<p>                       Friday Night Munay-Ki Rites</p> <p>Community Circle Meetup!</p> <p>WE"RE BACK!!!</p> <p>Moving to the 3rd Friday of each month</p> <p>at the Foundation of the Sacred Stream.</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/7/b/a/event_165438362.jpeg" /></p> <p>March 21, 2014 (3rd Friday new circle meeting date)<br/>April 18, 2014    (3rd Friday new circle meeting date)<br/>May 16, 2014 (3rd Friday new circle meeting date)</p> <p><br/>We invite you to discover the Nine Rites of Munay-Ki. These rites of Shamanic Awakening, Initiation and Empowerment are given in a Universal form and are for anyone receiving a calling from spirit. We are honored to share these Rites with you... as a FREE "Give Away" from Spirit.</p> <p>Drop in and receive a different Munay-Ki Rite each Second Friday of the month. These transmissions are passed as a Free "Give Away" from spirit...</p> <p>Please view the videos below to gain a deeper understanding of the Munay-Ki Rites and what to expect in our community circle!</p> <p><br/>Many have felt a calling from spirit and are awakening to make a difference in this world. We, as a people, are on a vision quest. Living a vision and questing for more of who we truly can become. We invite you to discover the Nine Rites of Munay-Ki and engage the quest for deeper, broader vision of who and what you truly are.</p> <p>The Nine Rites of the Munay-Ki are transmissions and attunements kept alive and handed down by lineage keepers of the wisdom traditions of shamanic cultures worldwide. The external form varies from culture to culture but the essence of the transmission is universal. What is handed down are transmissions of energetic seeds that when nurtured, quicken the path to spiritual development and enlightenment. They quicken our journey towards who and what we are becoming as a species. The seeds of these rites can grow within anyone. This is our human birthright and path.</p> <p>The Munay-Ki rites, as brought to us through the Q'ero Shamans of the Peruvian Andes, are a path of fire and a path of lightning; a fast track to recognizing our true divine nature. This all is a journey in space, time and energy. The  Munay-Ki is the  rocket fuel for this journey.</p> <p><br/>We are honored to share these rites with you...</p> <p>Join us now on this journey of discovery.</p> <p>The adventure continues the 3rd Friday of every month.</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aFor more information please contact:</p> <p>Kent Dorsey - <a href="mailto:[masked]">[masked]</a></p> <p>Suzanne Savage - &lt;a&gt;[masked]&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p>Please visit: <a href="http://www.centerforshamanichealing.com/">The Center For Shamanic Healing</a>,</p> <p><a href="http://www.munaykiawakening.com/">Munay-Ki Awakening</a></p> <p>and</p> <p><a href="http://www.spiritssong.com/">Spirits Song</a></p> <p><a href="http://events.r20.constantcontact.com/register/eventReg?llr=sobzuldab&amp;oeidk=a07e3v2pul8ff6a714a"><br/></a></p> <p>FREE EVENT</p> <p> </p> <p>Nine Great Rites of the Munay KI<br/>Dr. Alberto Villoldo introduces the rites of the Munay KI. Rites that have the potential to change the world. Munay Sonqo... Thank you for this gift to the world.</p> <p>undefined</p> <p> </p> <p>This video shows each of the Nine Rites being passed:</p> <p><br/>undefined</p> <p> </p> <p>NINE GREAT RITES OF THE MUNAY-KI</p> <p><br/>The Nine Rites of the Munay-Ki consists of two type of rites. The Foundation Rites and the Lineage Rites. The Foundation Rites consist of  The Healer\u2019s Rite, The Bands of Power, The Harmony Rites and The Seers\u2019 Rite prepare us with the needed tools for the initiations to come. These Foundation Rites prepares our luminous energy field to hold the vibration and power available in the next five rites, the Lineage Rites</p> <p>MUNAY = LOVE FROM THE HEART</p> <p>KI = ENGAGED AND IN MOTION</p> <p><br/>Foundation Rites</p> <p>Healer's Rite</p> <p>Connects you to a lineage of luminous beings from the past, who come to assist you in your personal transformation.  Awakens the healing power in your hands so that everyone you touch is blessed. There is tremendous spiritual assistance available, and these luminous ones work in our sleep to heal the wounds of the past and of our ancestors.</p> <p>Bands of Power</p> <p>Five luminous energetic bands representing earth, air, fire, water, and pure light that are woven into the luminous energy field (LEF) for protection. Through Intent they act as filters, breaking down all negative energy that comes toward the person, into one of the five elements.  These energies then feed your LEF instead of making you sick. The Bands of Power are always 'on', and negative energies bounce right off them. In a world filled with fear, the bands provide essential protection. The Bands bring us into union with all of the elements. They do not insulate us from life, but rather deepen our connection and attunment with the Earth and all the elements.</p> <p>Harmony Rite</p> <p>You receive seven allies bringing gifts of transformation and harmony. Four allies,  organizing principles of creation, are placed into your four lower Chakras as well as three "Archangels" into your upper Chakras.  In the first Chakra, you receive the ally of serpent; jaguar goes into the second; hummingbird into the third; and eagle into the fourth; next you receive three archangels:  the Keeper of the Lower World (our unconscious), the Keeper of the Middle World (our waking world), and the Protector of the Upper World (our super conscious). These allies are transmitted into your Chakras as seeds of energy, each a particular vibration. This is a path of literal enlightenment - Infusing light into each Chakra.</p> <p>Seer's Rite</p> <p>Reawakens the Shaman's way to perceiving the World. Five luminous Extra-cerebral pathways of light are woven and installed that connect the visual cortex with the third eye and two are woven that connect the heart chakra to the visual cortex. This awakens the "inner seer" and your ability to perceive the invisible world of energy and Spirit.</p> <p>Vibration of Angels and Archangels</p> <p>Lineage Rites:</p> <p>Daykeeper Rite</p> <p>This is a lineage Rite of the Divine Feminine. You connect to a lineage of master healers from the past who have fully awakened their nurturing ways. Daykeepers are able to call on the ancient altars to heal and bring balance to the earth, call on the sun to rise each day, and bring humans into harmony with mother Earth following the cycle of life.  They are the midwives, herbalists and curanderas.  This rite helps you begin to heal your inner feminine, step beyond fear, and practice peace.</p> <p>Wisdomkeeper's Rite</p> <p>This lineage rite offers gifts of the Divine Masculine. You connect to a lineage of luminous beings from the past and the future who have defeated death and stepped outside of time. This rite awakens stories that lift people up, speaking from a mythic realm to engage and lift with teaching stories. This rite is associated with the snow-capped mountains, perhaps a distant memory of our ancestors from the Himalayas. This rite helps you to begin to heal your inner masculine, step outside of time, become steeped in the medicine teachings and taste infinity.</p> <p>Earthkeeper Rite</p> <p>This rite connects you to the archangels that are guardians of our galaxy. The Earthkeepers, who are stewards of all life on the Earth, come under the direct protection of these archangels and can summon their power when they need to in order to bring healing and balance to any situation.This rite connects you to the stars, and to the sun, our local star. It helps you learn the ways of the seer and dream the world into being.</p> <p>Starkeeper's Rite</p> <p>This rite anchors you safely to the time after the great change, said to occur around 2012.  Your physical body begins to evolve into homo luminous, the aging process is slowed down, your DNA is re-informed, and you become more resistant to disease. When you receive these rites, you acquire stewardship of the time to come and all future generations.</p> <p><br/>Creator Rite</p> <p>Awakens the Creator-light within and brings forth a sense of stewardship for all creation, from the smallest grain of sand to the largest cluster of galaxies in the universe.  Once attained only through direct transmission from Spirit, it is now possible to transmit from one person to another.</p> <p>As you work with the germination of these rites you'll be touched and blessed by angels. You simply need to open yourself to the wisdom of the Earthkeepers, and all will be bestowed upon you.</p> <p> </p> <p>Facilitated by Kent Dorsey &amp; Suzanne Savage</p> <p>Please visit <a href="http://www.munaykiawakening.com/Welcome.html">Munay Ki Awakening</a> .</p> <p>Please visit the <a href="http://www.munaykiawakening.com/Welcome.html">Center For Shamanic Healing</a> website.</p> <p> </p> <p>FREE EVENT</p> <p> </p> <p>I understand that this and all other Center For Shamanic Healing training programs and events are offered for teaching purposes only and not for the purposes of providing healing or treating any student or participant for any physical or mental condition or illness.</p> <p>Disclaimer</p> <p>Shamanic  services and information on this website are offered to compliment medical and psychological advice and treatments.

V<p>Deep inside your heart lies an expansive spirit known as your soul. Few of us have ever touched this place, let alone spend our days and lives there. But through the grace and mercy of Divine Love, it is possible to travel inside to touch this secret garden, and to fly up through the heavens and gather the secret qualities which comprise your amazing soul.</p> <p>In this experiential, \u201chands on\u201d workshop, we will take a look at the qualities of your soul, help you get in touch with its beauty and majesty, and then use this foundation to begin healing yourself and your family line. In my experience as a teacher, there is no greater healing power than the beauty and mercy of God. By asking God to heal ourselves and our families, we can become the hands, eyes, ears, mind and heart of the greatest healing force in the Universe.</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/c/a/d/600_39708301.jpeg" /></p> <p><i>When: </i> Sat, August 16, 10:00am - 5:00pm  <br/><i>Where:</i>  Unitarian Church, 505 E Charleston Rd, Palo Alto, CA 94306 <br/><i>Tuition:</i>  Donation basis; please give what feels right \u2014 everyone welcome! <br/><i>Class size:</i>  30 participants max. <br/><i>Contact:</i>  Hasna Peggy - [masked] </p>

V<p>Startup Finance: Valuation</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/2/event_100045522.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>About:</b> Learn how to value a startup.</p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core. Valuation makes or breaks a company. It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job.

V<p>Debbie Lyn's Costumes will be helping the Geek Girls for our second Renaissance Faire Dressup Day. Check out their website for an exhaustive description of their services!</p> <p><a href="http://www.dlcostumes.com"><a href="http://www.dlcostumes.com" class="linkified">http://www.dlcostumes.com</a></a></p> <p><br/>I've timed this event so that folks attending the NorCal Renaissance Faire can buy or rent costumes for that event. You may, of course, bring a guest you want to dress up with (male guests allowed). However, Debbie is only expecting 6-10 of us, so we're limited to 10 spots. If you want help dressing up for Faire, snag a spot quick!</p> <p>I have not been to Debbie Lyn's before, so this will be a new experience for all of us. If it works out, we may even schedule future costume dates for Halloween or themed parties that I hope to do in the future (Roaring 20's Murder Mystery and Victorian Tea Party, for example.)</p>

V<p>Startup Finance: Valuation</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/2/event_100045522.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>About:</b> Learn how to value a startup.</p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core. Valuation makes or breaks a company. It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job.

V<p>We are declaring <b>WAR</b>! And not the thumb kind either. Our fellow gamers at the Petaluma-based Meetup <a href="http://www.meetup.com/geekery/">The Geekery</a> have challenged our established behavior of hating humankind by inviting us to have fun with them. The <i>gall</i>! How very <i>dare</i> them! We'll show them just how much we hate humankind by banding together and playing games and stuff.</p> <p>A <a href="http://www.ebparks.org/parks/miller_knox">neutral field</a> has been chosen for this (let's face it) unequivicable defeat, just north of where the misanthropes normally meet and just south of where the geekery meets. Hopefully that will accommodate the most people. We already have some ideas for some fun (Nerf vs. Zombies), but feel free to add some comments below if you are looking for anything specific. And, if you're one of the few people (read: traitors) that are part of both Meetups, you don't need to RSVP to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/geekery/events/194466762/">both</a>, but it certainly can't hurt.</p> <p>Misanthropes vs. geeks. North vs. South. Pink vs. orange. Brains vs. brawn. Alien vs. Predator. The State of Tennessee vs. John Thomas Scopes. Who will win? And, more importantly (if moms everywhere can be trusted), who will have fun? <b>You</b> decide!</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMore about the park can be found here:</p> <p><br/><a href="http://www.ebparks.org/parks/miller_knox"><a href="http://www.ebparks.org/parks/miller_knox" class="linkified">http://www.ebparks.org/parks/miller_knox</a></a></p> <p>Our meeting place will be near Lagoon View (for now), located at #2 on this map:</p> <p><a href="http://www.ebparks.org/Assets/_Nav_Categories/Parks/Maps/Miller+Knox+map.pdf"><a href="http://www.ebparks.org/Assets/_Nav_Categories/Parks/Maps/Miller+Knox+map.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.ebparks.org/Assets/_Nav_Categories/Parks/Maps/Miller+Knox+map.pdf</a></a></p> <p>More about the <b>enemy</b> can be found here:</p> <p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/geekery"><a href="http://www.meetup.com/geekery" class="linkified">http://www.meetup.com/geekery</a></a></p> <p>More about squirrels can be found here:</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel</a></a></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aDisclaimer: This is an outdoors event.

V<p>By Katherine Boo<br/>Rated 3.98 on Goodreads<br/>262 pages</p> <p><br/>From Pulitzer Prize-winner Katherine Boo, a landmark work of narrative nonfiction that tells the dramatic and sometimes heartbreaking story of families striving toward a better life in one of the twenty-first century\u2019s great, unequal cities.</p> <p>In this brilliantly written, fast-paced book, based on three years of uncompromising reporting, a bewildering age of global change and inequality is made human.</p> <p>Annawadi is a makeshift settlement in the shadow of luxury hotels near the Mumbai airport, and as India starts to prosper, Annawadians are electric with hope. Abdul, a reflective and enterprising Muslim teenager, sees \u201ca fortune beyond counting\u201c in the recyclable garbage that richer people throw away. Asha, a woman of formidable wit and deep scars from a childhood in rural poverty, has identified an alternate route to the middle class: political corruption. With a little luck, her sensitive, beautiful daughter \u2014 Annawadi's "most-everything girl" \u2014 will soon become its first female college graduate. And even the poorest Annawadians, like Kalu, a fifteen-year-old scrap-metal thief, believe themselves inching closer to the good lives and good times they call \u201cthe full enjoy.\u201d</p> <p>But then Abdul the garbage sorter is falsely accused in a shocking tragedy; terror and a global recession rock the city; and suppressed tensions over religion, caste, sex, power and economic envy turn brutal. As the tenderest individual hopes intersect with the greatest global truths, the true contours of a competitive age are revealed. And so, too, are the imaginations and courage of the people of Annawadi.</p> <p>With intelligence, humor, and deep insight into what connects human beings to one another in an era of tumultuous change, Behind the Beautiful Forevers carries the reader headlong into one of the twenty-first century\u2019s hidden worlds, and into the lives of people impossible to forget.</p>

V<p>The torches are lit, the theme is set... we're having a luau you'll never forget! </p> <p>We're going tropical on August 16, so break out the flip flops and leis and hula on by and come joins us for a "Lei'd Back" Hawaiian Luau Party!</p> <p><br/>Robert is kind enough to host this event at his house in Oakley where we can enjoy a day on the delta from his backyard! We will be BBQing shishkabobs so bring your favorite shishkabob meat to skew and BBQ, and a side dish to share (I will get a list going of hawaiian favorite side dishes to sign up for).</p> <p>There will be a Tiki Bar with tropical drinks served, so bring a bottle of rum or other alcoholic beverage of your choice.</p> <p>Music, games, water fun, hawaiian entertainment (more on that later), and a hula dancer are  just some of things you can expect, along with dancing the limbo and a hula hoop contest.</p> <p>Dress code is Tacky Tourist (go ahead, show us your worst!). Put on your craziest Hawaiian shirts and a lei, bring a swimsuit, sunblock and shades!</p> <p>Come join us for a hawaiian luau as we  play in the water, and hula on the Delta!</p> <p><br/>Mahalo.</p> <p>P.S. Robert's real address will be emailed to those who RSVP.</p> <p>History of the Luau</p> <p><br/>A <a href="http://www.hawaii-luaus.com/history.htm">luau</a>, a feast to mark an important celebratory occasion, such as a coming of age or visitors, is culturally rooted, festive and all about food, fun and family. Luaus have been part of Hawaiian culture since long before Westerners arrived to the islands. Up until about 150 years ago, Polynesians called their big celebratory feasts \u2018aha \u2018aina. These events were usually somewhat formal, with more ceremony and not such a party atmosphere. </p> <p>The modern term Luau may have originated from the great coed feasts of the Hawaiian King Kamehameha II. In traditional Hawaii, men and women were not allowed to eat together and all women were forbidden to eat certain kinds of foods in Hawaii. King Kamehameha II abolished these laws and many other religious laws in the year 1819 and validated this change by having a symbolic feast with women invited. </p> <p>At this feast one of the main dishes involved the wrapping of chicken in the young leaves of the Taro plant and baking it in coconut milk. This dish was called 'Luau' and as a result of its being one of the main courses of these feasts the feasts themselves came to be called 'Luaus.' Traditional Luaus are eaten on the ground, with food placed on Ti Leaves that cover a type of woven mat called the 'Lauhala' mats. </p> <p>the lei</p> <p>Guests at Luaus receive Leis as they arrive. The <a href="http://www.hawaiiflowerlei.com/leitradition.aspx">Lei</a>  is a necklace or headdress of woven flowers or shells and is given as a display of affection. A lei should be a welcomed celebration of one person's affection to another. Therefore, always accept a lei, never refuse. </p> <p>The proper way to wear a lei is gently draped over the shoulders, hanging down both in front and in back. It is considered rude to remove a lei from your neck in the presence of the person who gave it to you, so if you must, be discreet. </p> <p>Also when dressing up for the Luau women can place a flower behind their right or left ear. Placing a flower over the left ear indicates that one is taken or in a relationship and placing a flower over the right ear indicates that one is available.</p> <p>pu: the hawaiian conch shell</p> <p>Pu, a Hawaiian <a href="http://www.aloha-hawaii.com/hawaii/conch+shells/">conch shell</a> , is a large seashell that is blow into like a trumpet and often played for ceremonies. Made of two kinds of large shells, Triton or Cassis cornuta, it is capable of emitting a loud sound carrying as far as two miles. The volume depends on the style of blowing rather than breath volume capacity.</p> <p>In ancient times, the Pu was sometimes used to accompany chants, and most often used to announce the beginning of a ceremony and also to communicate the arrival of incoming ships.</p> <p>Today the Pu is used to announce the opening of the Hawaii State Legislature, presentation of the royal court at hula festivals and for traditional ceremonies. The Pu is also a popular commencement tool at weddings and luaus, and also has been used to honor royalty and famous people.</p> <p>fire dancing</p> <p>Fire dancing, now very popular on the Hawaiian Islands, is a tradition that came from traditional Somoan knife dancing. The ailao, a fierce traditional dance that involves the twirling of the nifo oti (war knife), was a pre-war ritual in Samoa used to psyche up warriors. Letuli Olo Misilagi was the first man to add fire to the traditional Samoan ailao, or knife dance.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.aloha-hawaii.com/dining/samoan+fire+knife+dance/">Samoan fire knife dance</a></p> <p> is more than a popular spectacle that adds sizzle to a Hawaiian luau. It\u2019s a tradition that has been passed from generation to generation, with each adding a new layer of style, boldness and skill.</p> <p>Today, of course, the Samoan fire knife dance is a show-stopping staple in Polynesian revues or luaus. There are fire knife dance competitions held throughout the Pacific, including the annual World Fire Knife Dance Competition at the Polynesian Cultural Center (PCC) on Oahu.</p> <p>Says event founder Pulefano Galeai, "This unique event combines great athletic skill, unflinching bravery and ever-present danger to bring out the best in these competitors. It\u2019s exciting to see the culture of Samoa take center stage with participation from people around the world." </p> <p>grass skirts</p> <p>The most famous symbol of the Hawaiian hula is the <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/J0110077/hulahistory.htm">grass skirt</a> . The grass skirt was introduced to Hawaii in the early 1800s by laborers who arrived in Hawaii from the Gilbert Islands. Traditionally the Hawaiians used Ti leaves; the Ti leaf is wider than the thinner strands of grass that are used today.</p>

V<p>Once again we will get together, for more Fun, Food, and Frivolity with fellow film fans! </p> <p>Yes, it's time for our:</p> <p><i><b>Summer Movie Meetup Party!!</b></i></p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/3/d/6/highres_155601462.jpeg" /></p> <p>We'll gather at a private club house, in Los Altos on Saturday, August 16. The exact address, and a map, will be emailed to everyone who RSVPs "yes," a week prior to the event.  There'll be lots of food and drink to share.  See the Pot-Luck list below.  Enjoy the socializing and conversation with other witty sophisticates.  Challenge yourself and others with trivia; two, new games and the return of the diabolical, "Connect the Clues" game!!! Vie for "valuable" prizes. <i><b>RSVPs, open Sat., July 19!</b></i>  </p> <p><img src="http://img1.meetupstatic.com/816470374029094449829953/img/smileys/devilish.gif" /></p> <p><i><b>Important</b>: We are inviting members from both SF Bay Area Classic Films and Palo Alto Independent Films to attend, and <b>we need to limit the number to a *total* of thirty-five (35) people.

We won't be taking payments at the door, so please pay when you sign up! <i><b>To help us prepare, we will be closing RSVPs a week prior to the event, on Saturday, August 9, so don't procrastinate, and risk missing out! </b></i></p> <p><img src="http://img2.meetupstatic.com/660856251752819977145734/img/smileys/crying.gif" /></p> <p><b>The Pot-Luck</b></p> <p>We will provide drinks and condiments (plus all cups, plates, napkins, utensils, ice, etc.), but the food we'll do potluck style! Bring a dish from one of the categories below, sufficient to share with three (3) other people, and note the category in your RSVP comment, so we can balance the menu, if needed. Here are the categories:</p> <p>\u2022 Appetizers/Snacks</p> <p>\u2022 Salad</p> <p>\u2022 Entreé (meat or vegetarian; please indicate)</p> <p>\u2022 Vegetables/Side dish</p> <p>\u2022 Dessert</p> <p>Please bring any serving utensils you may require. (Gas grills, a full range/oven, and fridge/freezer will be available, if needed. Please provide your own equipment (pot holders, spatulas, roasting pans, etc.))</p> <p>So, that's it! As always we'll have lots of food and fun with some of the most enthusiastic film fans in the Bay Area! What's not to like? Don't miss out: <i><b>RSVP starting July 19th!!! </b></i></p> <p><img src="http://img1.meetupstatic.com/614102232183174521616/img/smileys/wink.gif" /></p> <p><i><b>We'll See You on Saturday, August 16!!!</b></i></p> <p>P.S.: As a special treat, hang out after the party (but help clean up first -- the sooner we're done, the quicker the fun) and enjoy a light, summer movie. Stay tuned for details! </p>

V<p>Synopsis:  The classic tale of King Arthur and and his Knights of the Round Table...as told by Monty Python.  Really, need I say more?</p> <p>Spamalot is an outrageously goofy musical with an upbeat score and clever lyrics, lovingly ripped off from the classic cult comedy Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  This will be the second time I will have seen it; it's that good.</p> <p><br/>Audiences everywhere are eating up Spamalot which tells the story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table on their quest for the Holy Grail in the irreverent signature style of Monty Python. Flying cows, killer rabbits, taunting Frenchmen and show-stopping musical numbers add up to one of the greatest and funniest Broadway musicals of the modern age!</p> <p><br/>The 2005 Broadway production won three Tony Awards, including Best Musical, and received 14 Tony Award nominations.</p> <p>We'll meet for Happy Hour and appetizers near the City Lights Theater.</p> <p><br/>Happy Hour: 6:30  located TBD</p> <p>Play Begins: 8:00</p> <p>Buy tickets at http: <a href="http://www.cltc.org">www.cltc.org</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.cltc.org">The Light Rail stops just a few blocks away in case you don't want to pay for parking.<br/></a></p>

V<p>Half people bring a bottle of wine, half bring some sort of finger food (preferably not dessert...we over did the dessert a bit last time :P). Then we can do some wine tasting. You can say what you're bringing in the comments and I'll have a running list in the details so we can keep track. </p> <p>I don't think everyone will get a taste of all the wines, but we can rate the wines and the winner can get a prize! I don't know what yet, but I'll come up with something good...Please nothing crazy expensive as far as wine goes. Cheap is awesome! </p> <p><br/>And we can set up the gaming areas again, of course. :)</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aWine:</p> <p>Jen</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aFinger food:</p> <p>Rachel</p> <p>Sally</p>

V<p>         The Sunday Hikers are Meeting over at Hap Magee Ranch in Danville this week . <b>8 : 30 am Start</b> <b>time</b> for this 5 mile ,Moderate rated - Half Urban (neighborhoods of Alamo ) and Half Wide Fire Trails that include the Las Trampas Park hillside on the Prestigious West Side Alamo .</p> <p>           THIS HIKE IS RATED MODERATE :  Depending on the groups pace for this hike , it is not especially difficult , but could be considered somewhat challenging if a fast pace is kept up . <b>The group as a whole sets the speed of the hike -we do wait for the group to catch up at trail intersections - if all attendees want to walk fast then we walk the speed of the group as a whole group effort - It is not our intention to walk / hike the pace of the slowest hiker. PLEASE understand your physical hiking</b> <b>ability and hike within your means !</b></p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/3/6/600_382453622.jpeg" /></p> <p>        Come see a awesome route that includes the chance to see some great views from the top of Las trampas and several interesting homes along the quiet lanes in a high end neighborhood , great for anyone who enjoys Architecture and Landscape details . This is the one hike everyone will be talking about .</p> <p>      Dogs are welcome on this hike , must be leashed up when on the city streets and free to travel the trails when on the fire roads. Can your dog walk the full 5 mile loop route  - you have to decide .</p> <p>      Reminder to all hikers ,bring ample drinking water for the 2 1/2 hour event and wear sturdy footwear designed for hiking on loose dirt surfaces !</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/6/0/8/600_382453832.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/c/2/600_382453762.jpeg" /></p>

If you arrive around 10:30 you can get in, but you won't be able to see anything.</p> <p>Let's bring games, picnics, cameras, blankets and sunscreen and have a great day. The wait is also relaxing and fun. Bring a big jacket too, cuz it's always foggy here and i've never seen a warm day at Stern Grove.</p> <p>Unfortunately it's nowhere near BART, so driving ends up being the easier way to get there (carpool is possible).</p>

V<p><b>ABOUT THE HIKE</b></p> <p>This will be 7-3/4 mile moderate hike, from sea level to 739' elevation, starting at the Crissy Field Warming Hut and going across the Golden Gate Bridge to the Marin Headlands and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area to Kirby Cove.</p> <p>On a clear &amp; warm day, there will be beautiful photo opportunities. </p> <p><b>THINGS TO BRING (suggested)</b></p> <p>\u2022 Water, Snacks, Lunch</p> <p>\u2022 Hydration</p> <p>\u2022 Sunscreen</p> <p>\u2022 Layered clothing</p> <p><b>WHERE TO MEET </b></p> <p><b>Warming Hut Bookstore &amp; Cafe</b></p> <p>There is bathroom at the parking lot outside the Warming Hut, where we will meet @9;30. The warming hut sells coffee, hot chocolate, tea, pastries, and some snacks but not meals. Another option if you want to buy your food, is to get it at Safeway in the Marina that is 1/2 mile away. You'll get alot more choices and variety there.</p> <p>Depending on our pace of our group, we can probably get to the beach in 1.5-2.0 hours. We will eat when we reach Kirby Cove, a very beautiful cove with awesome views of the GGB &amp; Bay, where you'll also have plenty of opportunity to snap pics. After our lunch, we will head back. There will be another vista point stop for those who are interested in photography. There will be bathrooms in 3 spots during the walk. </p> <p>\u2022 Extreme high temperature or extreme fog/cold &amp;  will call for a re-schedule of the hike.</p> <p><br/><b>Safety Disclaimer: The organizers of this meet-up are unpaid volunteers and not expert hiking guides.

V<p>I love doing this run and ending up at the Ft. Mason Farmer's Market then getting a fresh crepe or rice and chili bowl from Greens. For 10 miles I run along the Marina and the Bay to Crissy Field, then take the Park Trail through the Presidio and along the Presidio golf club to the Bay Trail to the GG Bridge, then back along Crissy Field and the Marina to Ft. Mason. There's about 400 feet of elevation on this run, and mostly non-paved surfaces. My pace is average, around 12-13 minutes per mile. Bring water, especially if it's sunny!</p>

V<p>Join us for another day of local wine tasting...this time in the South Bay hills!  We'll start out at Spread, where you can pick up a picnic lunch or other yummies to accompany the wine.  We're going to visit four local tasting rooms, so you will need some sustenance along the way!  Feel free to pack your own lunch instead if you like.  Just know that we cannot live by wine crackers alone!</p> <p>We will spend a leisurely day visiting <a href="http://www.rrvcwines.com/">Ruthe Robert Wine Collective</a>, <a href="http://savannahchanelle.com/">Savannah Chanelle Vineyard</a>, <a href="http://blackridgevineyards.com/">Black Ridge Vineyards</a>, and <a href="http://www.testarossa.com/">Testarossa Winery</a>.  There are great views, a nice walking path, and live piano on the journey.  So dress comfy, and be prepared to unwind!</p> <p>Wine is (of course) available at each stop for $10-20 per flight, which is generally waived/refunded with bottle purchase.  You are welcome to share a flight, or skip something altogether as you wish.  No pressure, and please be sure to drink responsibly.</p> <p>We will end our day back in downtown Campbell.  There, we will find a place for dinner or go our separate ways.  As you wish.  This is a day to enjoy.  :)</p> <p><i>Note: I will be driving, but we will need additional drivers if more than one other person signs up!  Please post a comment if you have a ride or need a ride. </i></p>

V<p>This workshop is an introduction to Backbone.js, a popular front-end javascript library for creating dynamic, interactive web interfaces. It will be co-taught by Pamela Fox and Brenda Jin, and will include lunch.</p> <p><br/>We'll cover Backbone.JS Models, Views, Events, and CRUD, with hands-on exercises throughout. As a prerequisite, you should feel comfortable with JavaScript/jQuery and hopefully have attended our JS <a href="http://www.teaching-materials.org/jsmvc/">MVC</a>/<a href="http://www.teaching-materials.org/jsoo/">OO</a> workshops.</p> <p>If you're interested in helping out as a teaching assistant, please let us know.</p> <p><br/>Many thanks to our sponsor <b>HackReactor</b> for the wonderful space.</p> <p><br/>If you'd like to attend but cannot afford the cost, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHRPTms0blNlTlo3cUpySFJENzBEdWc6MQ">request a GDI scholarship</a>.</p> <p>Please note that we cannot issue refunds, since there's an overhead to issuing refunds via Meetup.com and we already offer the workshops at such a low-cost. We put proceeds into the chapter fund, which we use as our scholarship fund.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

V<p><i>If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound</i>?</p> <p>In the conclusion to the lecture and lab series on the science of the senses, the question of reality will be addressed in a self-exploratory session led by Matt Harbowy, scientist, hacker, and <i>advocatus diaboli</i>.  The question of "what is real?" will be investigated, and the viewpoints of the philosophers of science will be discussed. You will learn how to spot when a scientist is lying to you. The truths and lies discussed in the prior five sessions will be reviewed, and participants in prior sessions will be invited to conduct encore sessions of their favorite experiments. The process of peer review will be discussed, and you will learn how to peer review the work of other scientists. Most of all, we will have fun exploring our sixth sense.</p> <p>You are encouraged to bring a smartphone or tablet computer to the presentation so that you can collect data in our online lab notebook and share your results with the whole class- and will be provided online tools to continue the discovery at home. Technology is not needed to enjoy the class- bring your curiosity. </p> <p>This class is planned for June 21st, 2013 and is part 6 of a 6 part lecture and lab on the senses.</p>

V<p>Bring your projects - patterns you're about to make, WIPs (works in progress), or completed garments  (successes and failures) - and let's discuss fabric choices, including why you chose a particular fabric and why it worked (or not), what fabrics you're considering for an upcoming project, mixing prints, working with directional fabrics, and more!</p> <p>What fabric do you choose for a garment? Do you follow a pattern's recommended fabrics or do you ignore the suggestions? Is there a "wrong" fabric or not? What "wrong" fabrics have you used in a garment? </p> <p>This month's pattern giveaway is <a href="http://threadtheory.ca/">Thread Theory</a>'s oh-so-cool <a href="http://threadtheory.ca/collections/store/products/goldstream">Goldstream Peacoat</a>! Thread Theory is a Canadian menswear sewing pattern company. You can buy their paper patterns via their website or as PDF downloads. </p> <p>As always, Bay Area Sewists receive a 20% discount at Stonemountain &amp; Daughter Fabrics on meetup days! And this time, all you need to do is go downstairs to shop. :)</p> <p><b>Date: Sunday, August 17</b><br/><b>1:30pm to 1:45 pm</b> - Introductions and announcements<br/><b>1:45 pm to 3:25 pm</b> - Show &amp; Tell and discussion of fabric<br/><b>3:30 pm</b> - Pattern drawing and group photo!</p> <p><b>Location:</b> Stonemountain &amp; Daughter Fabrics, 2518 Shattuck Ave., upstairs classroom space. Street parking is available (watch the meters!). The store is within walking distance from the Downtown Berkeley BART stop.</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b> They only have 15 chairs so the RSVPs are limited to 15. BUT if you can bring your own chair, we can likely fit 5 more people. I'll wait to see how many people are on the wait list and whether they can bring their own chair before I increase the RSVPs.</p>

V<p>Before the summer gives way to a beautiful autumn, let's celebrate its glory by spending a half day in Half Moon Bay. PART 1: We'll first meet in front of Miramar Beach Restaurant, Half Moon Bay, and hit the beach trail. Walk on the beautiful beach and the scenic coastal trail for about 90 minutes. PART 2: Then we'll drive up the road to Half Moon Bay Brewing Company on the beach front for a relaxing dinner/nibbles and the brew.</p> <p>PART 3: At 5 PM, Steve Lucky &amp; Rhumba Bums with Ms. Carmen Getit will take the stage to begin a fun evening of the great Swing music and dance. Bring your dance shoes for this, and perhaps a change of clothes.</p> <p>You can join the Meetup at all of or any point of the 3-part day plan. As it gets closer, I will post some car-pool info in the comment section.</p>

V<p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/c/d/e/600_358395582.jpeg" /></p> <p>In memoriam this month of the centenary of World War One, we bring you Maugham's scathing indictment of its results on British Society. Set in 1931 at the country estate of Leonard Ardsley a well-off solicitor and patriarch, the interactions of his four children with family friends, spouses, and lovers reveal the extent of the war's mental and physical destruction, and the need for change. Loaded with emotive scenes and tidbits of cultural history, this reading will give us a feast for discussion.</p> <p><b>For Services Rendered is a play in three acts -</b> set in a house in a small country town near Kent. </p> <p>This is one of Maugham's most famous plays. </p> <p>There are twelve characters, six women and six men.</p> <p><b>Characters</b></p> <p><b>Leonard Ardsley </b></p> <p><b> Charlotte Ardsley</b>, his wife </p> <p><b> Sydney</b>, his son </p> <p><b> Eva</b>, his unmarried daughter </p> <p> <b>Lois</b>, his unmarried daughter </p> <p><b> Ethel Bartlett,</b> his married daughter </p> <p><b> Howard Bartlett</b>, her husband </p> <p><b> Collie Stratton</b>, Commander, RN </p> <p><b> Wilfred Cedar </b></p> <p><b> Gwen</b>, his wife </p> <p><b> Dr Prentice</b>, Mrs Ardsley's brother </p> <p><b> Gertrude</b>, the Ardsley's parlourmaid</p> <p><b><i>The action takes place in the Ardsley's house at Rambleston, a small country town in Kent, near the cathedral city of Stanbury.</i></b></p>

V<p><b>LOCATION:</b> Alexis's house near Geary and 22nd Ave in San Francisco. Exact address will be emailed to RSVPed attendees the day before the meetup.</p> <p>I've been doing a lot of bead crochet ropes lately because it's an easy and *very* portable project to do when you have a bit of free time.  I'm not an expert by any means, but I figured I could show people how to do it if they're interested.</p> <p>The youtube video included here and <b><a href="http://www.fusionbeads.com/Crocheted-Rope">this tutorial</a></b> really helped me figure it out, so take a look.  You can use whatever size/shape beads you want, but for learning I would recommend size 6 or 8 beads, <a href="http://www.joann.com/aunt-lydia-s-crochet-cotton-classic-size-10/12377065.html">size 10 thread</a>, and a <a href="http://www.joann.com/clover-soft-touch-crochet-hook-size-7-45mm/1622380.html#q=crochet+hook+7&amp;start=8">size 7 crochet hook</a>.  </p> <p>The very first step of crocheting a rope of beads is to string ALL OF THE BEADS.  So if you want to get a head start, you could string all your beads before you arrive.  Otherwise, you could just string a bit when you arrive and then use that to make a sample.  <a href="http://www.beadline.com/bead-chart.pdf">Here is a chart that tells you how much to string</a> (pdf) for a 6-around rope for a few different sizes of beads (but start with big beads, I promise you'll be MUCH happier.)  </p> <p>I recommend starting with a spiral of colors like you'll see in the video.  I really, really, really recommend it.  :-)</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXpXqde-PKY" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXpXqde-PKY</a></p> <p>If you're not into this, feel free to bring whatever you're working on and hang out with us. There is no charge for meetups, though we love it when people bring snacks. Beginners are welcome!</p>

V<p>Are you still hungry? Say: CHEESE PLEASE!</p> <p>The Cheeseballs just added a new concert to their event calendar in Crockett on August 17. If you were unable to see them at Barone's on July 10, will here's your chance to recover a lost opportunity-and it's free!  They will be performing at the community center in Crockett. If you have never seen them then let me assure you this is worth the drive on a quiet Sunday afternoon. This is the day after the Luau and what better way to end the weekend then to soak in some sunshine while snackin on some Cheeseball's.   </p> <p>The Cheeseballs. The name says it all: groovy, funky, danceable FUN! Just ask the tens of thousands of fans who have already experienced them. They will tell you stories of standing on the bar singing "I Will Survive" at the top of their lungs or dancing so hard to "We Are Family" that getting out of bed the next day was quite an event.</p> <p>That's what The Cheeseballs do; they make you "Shake Your Booty" like it hasn't been shaken in years. The band members pride themselves on serving up a helping of non-stop 70's disco dance hits and 80's and 90' s pop classics with an uncanny knack of performing songs that you will be surprised to discover you knew all the words to, such as "YMCA," "Stayin\u2019 Alive," "Dancing Queen," "Le Freak," "Disco Inferno," and many more (see song list). The result is always an audience dancing along and singing along.</p> <p>Over the last decade The Cheeseballs have performed everywhere from Las Vegas to Hawaii, at large public events, private parties and capacity-filled dance clubs. They have rung in the New Year at venues ranging from the Atrium of San Francisco's landmark Hyatt Embarcadero Hotel to historic Union Station in Kansas City, MO. The Cheeseballs memorably sung their own groovy acappela rendition of "The Star Spangled Banner" to 50,000 San Francisco Giants fans at SBC Park. Whether playing to a crowd of 100 or 10,000, they'll make sure everyone ends up on the dance floor. The Cheeseballs headline and sell out at all of the Bay Area's premier venues, including Bimbo's 365 Club, The Great American Music Hall, and Slim's.</p> <p>The band is comprised of 8 performers dressed in dazzling retro disco outfits and presents a parade of personalities who alternate lead vocals with plenty of exuberantly choreographed dance moves. You won't be disappointed. Just pick up the phone and say... "Cheese, Please!"</p> <p> </p>

V<p>Sometimes you just need to be singing with people, even if you think you don't know how to sing. The act of singing is simply an expression to communicate freely. This is an incredible gathering that supports the powerful voice of expression that lies within each and every one of us. We will explore the singing of inspiring Gospel and American folk songs leaving you connected and most of all...filled with joy!</p> <p>We meet once every month. All are welcome! No experience necessary.<br/>(All ages and all levels). Pure inspiration!</p> <p><b>No one turned away for lack of funds.</b></p>

V<p>Hello foam rolling members!  I have some good news.  I found someone to sub for me for the next 3 meet ups while I am out on maternity leave.  His name is Sean and he is a therapist from our studio here at Loosen up Bodywork.  I will most likely be there on February 17th to assist him on his first class but then he will take over for March and April.  I'm happy you can all keep up with your rolling while I'm away and you can always reach me through the meetup group here if you have any questions.  See you soon!</p>

V<p>Welcome to the new and improved community crafting event!  This free meetup is held here at the conference room in Santa Clara at the offices of CommuniTAS where we hold most of our classes.</p> <p> </p> <p>Since so many of our extremely talented members have many and various types of crafts to do, including the paper arts, drawing, stamping, card making, scrap booking, quilting, embroidery, knitting, and jewelry making, we've decided to rename these three (3) free nights of crafting as "Community Crafting" nights, rather than knitting, needles or jewelry.</p> <p> </p> <p>So, we now welcome ALL crafters to the community room on the first, third and fourth Mondays of the month to share your craft, your art, and your projects with all of us!!  Show us your stuff, and bring your great crafts to the meetup!</p> <p> </p> <p>Although this is a FREE meetup, we do ask that everyone please keep their RSVP's updated at all times.  There is limited space in this meetup and its not fair for anyone to RSVP and never show up.  Please know that if you can with less than 5 days notice to the host, you will be given an attendance violation for the year.  Repeated offenses can result in removal from the group.  Please remember the rules and keep your RSVPs updated at all times.  thanks!</p>

The company and the product grew exponentially since then. Now we have almost hundred engineers with robust processes and infrastructure. And we still have code running in production from that one repository in the beginning.</p> <p>My talk will not cover the shiny new future but the journey from the crazy childhood through the maturing process to the very happy, care-free end of the the old code. Learnings, regretted decisions, success stories all along the way. </p> <p><i>Akos is the tech lead manager of the Core Product team. He loves data driven feature development and is passionate about UX. He joined Prezi in the early days, therefore h</i>e's one of the engineers in the company who has the biggest knowledge about our systems.</p> <p><b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=7316807">Pierre Ingmansson</a> (Prezi) \u2014 How to upgrade stateful servers without downtime</b></p> <p>Prezi Collaboration uses a stateful in-memory chat server to synchronize changes between users that have the same Prezi open. In this talk I will explain the architecture of this system, how we make it scalable and how to deploy new code to our stateful servers without downtime. </p> <p><i>Pierre is a full stack web developer at Prezi working with everything from infrastructure to implementing web designs. He is passionate about distributed systems, clean code, drumming and chicken wings.<br/></i></p> <p><i>\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0</i></p> <p>\u000a\u000a<b>Schedule</b></p> <p>6:30pm - Doors open</p> <p>7:00pm - Doors close, first presentation starts</p> <p>7:30pm - Second presentation starts</p> <p>8:45pm - Lights off</p> <p>Drinks and snacks are provided by Prezi.</p>

V<p>Multi-instrumentalist and blues vocalist Chris Cain, whose performance on guitar and piano thrilled us all during a recent Meetup outing to see the Ray Charles Project, brings his own band to Yoshi's for what will surely be an energy-packed show.</p> <p><br/><b>TICKETS:</b> Buy own tickets; cost for the show is about $20 per person with the Yoshi's service fee OR about 25 percent less if you use Yoshi's SUMMER promocode (good through July 19th if supplies last.)  General-admission seating.  <a href="http://www.yoshis.com/oakland/jazzclub/artist/show/4328"><a href="http://www.yoshis.com/oakland/jazzclub/artist/show/4328" class="linkified">http://www.yoshis.com/oakland/jazzclub/artist/show/4328</a></a></p> <p><b>WHEN/WHERE TO MEET:</b> Meet by 7:30 p.m. in Yoshi's lobby near Will Call OR, if there's a line outside the door, meet in line. (The show starts at 8:00 p.m.; doors to the performance area open at 7:30 p.m.) </p> <p><b>HOW TO FIND ME:</b> My photo is on the Meetup site. I'm WF, in my late 50s, 5 feet tall, with short auburn hair. I'll send my cellphone number and more info to RSVPers. I'll carry my trusty Oakland museum shoulder bag (museum name in big orange caps) as a "marker."</p> <p><b>NOTE:</b> I normally schedule a dinner before Yoshi's shows to qualify for reserved seating, but I'm on a tight work schedule, so I can't do that for this weeknight show. However, a similar menu is available at tables during the show. <i>If anyone's available to get in line earlier than me to increase our odds of snagging good general-admission seating, that's cool, too.</i></p> <p><b>CHRIS CAIN WEBSITE:</b></p> <p><a href="http://www.chriscainmusic.com/index.html"><a href="http://www.chriscainmusic.com/index.html" class="linkified">http://www.chriscainmusic.com/index.html</a></a></p> <p><br/><b>CHIS CAIN VIDEOS:</b></p> <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22CHRIS+CAIN%22" class="embedded">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22CHRIS+CAIN%22</a></p>

We welcome anyone to attend a GoRampUp! meeting, once, for free as our guest, so you can learn what the innovative GoRampUp! business-networking experience is all about. Note, we are not able to give you a free meeting at more than one of our many locations.</p> <p>YOU MUST obtain a free-access GoRampUp! Golden ticket by registering for a specific meeting at<a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar/"><a href="http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/" class="linkified">http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/</a></a>. This ticket must be presented at your complimentary meeting for you to gain admittance. Without this ticket you will, unfortunately, be declined access to our innovative and exclusive business-networking meeting. WITH a GoRampUp! Golden Ticket, you will be welcomed with open arms!</p> <p>It can be too difficult to attract new clients. We help you fix that! We're a business-impact community. We're informal and fun, yet, by design, we're extremely effective!</p> <p>We help people who work for a living to get a much greater payoff from working. We do this in three specific ways under our three CoreSuccess Platforms: 1) We help you move toward mastery with business-networking, 2) We help you move toward mastery with business performance, and, 3) We help you move toward mastery with personal development.</p> <p>How do we deliver on this promise to our community members? Each month we conduct dozens of business-networking meetings in more than a dozen cities in the SF Bay Area. A member may attend all of our "OpenConnect" business-networking meetings. And our members are welcome and encouraged to attend any and all of these meetings and locations.</p> <p>Each month we introduce and emphasize a learning and development subject under each of our three CoreSuccess Platforms. For each of the three learning and development subjects that we introduce and emphasize each month, we give you four different ways to learn it: We produce written learning guides, video learning guides, audio learning guide, and we cover the subjects as 15-to-20-minute mini-workshops inside of our 60-minute business-networking meetings. There's no registration or initiation fee to join. Membership in GoRampUp! is month to month. You enroll when you like, even mid-month, and you depart when you like.</p> <p>Be sure to see our website to learn about <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/growrampup">our generous enrollment incentives</a></p> <p>Also, be sure to learn about our <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/norisk">100-Satisfaction Money-Back Guarantee</a></p> <p>Would you care to come to this meeting, at no cost, to see if there\u2019s business-value for you?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">Free-Meeting Guest-RSVP and Golden Ticket Request</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">View complete meeting details</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/invite">Invite a Buddy to join you</a></p> <p>One last thing: You REALLY should check out actual testimonial videos by our members: <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/why">See them here</a></p> <p>This page was created to produce awareness of our event.

V<p>A lot of applications use relational databases to save, retrieve, and aggregate data. We talk to those databases using SQL. When we start out as developers, the database tasks we're assigned will usually involve basic SQL: simple inserts, updates, and selects-- perhaps joining on a table or twelve. Of course, if you switch databases, your SQL might not work anymore. In complex applications, legacy apps, and reporting tools, these basics won't be enough. In this movie sequel themed lecture, Jen Larkin will discuss some of the inconsistencies in the basics, then demonstrate some cool and some scary things that SQL can do. I'll show how more complex SQL can make queries run faster, identify problem data, and even fix bad data. This talk will have one very simple example in CFML, but will otherwise be (non-SQL) language agnostic.</p> <p><br/><i>Do or do not. There is no TRY</i>-- at least not in Oracle, but it has EXCEPTION.</p>

V<p>Folks,</p> <p><br/>mark your calendars for this exciting event about Swing Trading.</p> <p><br/>Learning how to take the ego out of the trade is one of the hardest obstacles that most traders need to overcome.  Trading isn\u2019t about being right or being wrong. Trading shouldn\u2019t be about money. Trading should only be about trading. It\u2019s about having a plan, and being in control.  Let\u2019s face it, either you control the trade or the trade controls you. If you trade correctly, the money will come.</p> <p>Learning how to Day Trade will increase your odds as a long term swing trader. Reading the tape, otherwise known as your time and sales window is following the smart money. It\u2019s <b><i>old fashioned trading in a high tech world</i></b>.   The Stock Whisperer will show you how she finds the hot stock of the day otherwise known as <b>The Whisper</b>.  She will also show you her six simple rules of overnight swing trading and how to use volume as your number one indicator to help you enter only the highest probability trades. As a bonus she will share how she finds her infamous <b>\u201cT\u201d spot</b> otherwise known as the trend change. How would you like to be able to spot a correction before it happens by learning how to read it in the tape?  In this introductory workshop the Stock Whisperer will share pictures she has taken of real time trades. She will point out where the smart money is selling so that you can spot the next correction before it comes.  </p> <p><b>Biography</b></p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/3/a/600_376004602.jpeg" /></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p>Stefanie Kammerman, aka The Stock Whisperer has trained over a thousand traders worldwide how to Day Trade and Swing Trade over the past 20 years. She earned a BA in Psychology from FAU but decided to pursue her passion for the stock market. In 1994, she started out as an assistant trader at the prestigious Schoenfeld Securities. In 1996, she became the first female trader for Onsite Trading, winning the trader of the year award her first year. She successfully ran a trading desk over the next few years teaching all the new traders the overnight swing system.  Stefanie is also a published singer/songwriter with BMI, having placed numerous songs on some of the most popular television shows such as \u201cAmericas\u2019 got talent,\u201d and \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d just to name a few. </p> <p>She is the founder and director of The Stock Whisperer Trading Company, where she runs an online educational trading room called \u201cThe Java Pit\u201d.  She teaches her students by sharing her screen all day long with many audio meetings.   Her unique approach of old fashioned trading in a high tech world teaches her students how to trade by reading the tape.  She is the author of \u201cCounting the Cards of Wall Street\u201d, an online workshop which focuses on trading around volume and technical analysis. She has taken hundreds of pictures of real time trades in an effort to teach her students how to follow the smart money.  She also does live workshops where she teaches her students in real time.  Stefanie has recently presented at the New York traders Expo, The San Francisco Money Show, the Vancouver Trader\u2019s Expo, the Toronto Money Show and presented alongside Larry Berman during his 2014 Speaking Tour across Canada.  </p> <p>6:00 to 7:00 PM: Introductions and networking</p> <p>7:00 to 8:30: Stephanie Kammerman presentation </p> <p>This will be a wonderful educational event that will focus on swing trading. I encourage all members, new or experienced to come and listen to Stephanie who is flying all the way from NY to present to us.</p> <p><br/>Englander Pub has great food and drinks. Come hungry and thirsty. There is plenty of free parking.</p> <p><br/>Happy Trading!</p> <p><br/>Bobby</p>

For her dissertation, funded in part by the National Science Foundation, she used natural language processing methods to measure how political cultures unify collective action. In September she will begin as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Kellogg of School of Management at Northwestern University, where she will use computational techniques to study social movements and social media. Nelson is co-organizing a 24-hour Datathon in conjunction with the American Sociological Association's annual conference, taking place in August in San Francisco. During the event, titled "Big cities, big data: Big opportunity for computational social science", teams will compete to transform data into information. </p>

V<p>We're now meeting once a month to do cool stuff. Join a conversation, or bring your own idea to pitch.</p> <p><br/>We've got a bunch of awesome projects underway:</p> <p>\u2022 <b>DIY air quality monitoring:</b> Help us figure out how to build, install, use, and share air quality monitors and data. We're especially keen on how to create school programs to teach kids about air pollution, air quality data, and what they can do to use data to influence policy.</p> <p>\u2022 <b>Grassroots bioblitzes:</b> We're building an ongoing program of grassroots, citizen science bioblitzes where we use our smartphones and the <a href="http://inaturalist.org">iNaturalist platform</a> to gather tons of data about the plants, animals, and fungi of local parks. Awesome!</p> <p>\u2022 <b>Monitoring change:</b> We created a project to monitor landscape change and fire recovery. Help us refine the project and work on exporting the model. <a href="http://nerdsfornature.org/monitor-change/"><a href="http://nerdsfornature.org/monitor-change/" class="linkified">http://nerdsfornature.org/monitor-change/</a></a></p> <p>\u2022 <b>Drones for Science:</b> We have a slew of cool partners to create hardware to study the outdoors.</p> <p><br/>\u2022 <b>Your project?</b> Nerds for Nature is all volunteer, all grassroots. Bring your project ideas!</p>

V<p>In the ruthless arena of King Henry VIII\u2019s court, only one man dares to gamble his life to win the king\u2019s favor and ascend to the heights of political power.<br/>England in the 1520s is a heartbeat from disaster. If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years, and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe opposes him. The quest for the king\u2019s freedom destroys his adviser, the brilliant Cardinal Wolsey, and leaves a power vacuum.<br/>Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell is a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people and a demon of energy: he is also a consummate politician, hardened by his personal losses, implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph?<br/>In inimitable style, Hilary Mantel presents a picture of a half-made society on the cusp of change, where individuals fight or embrace their fate with passion and courage. With a vast array of characters, overflowing with incident, the novel re-creates an era when the personal and political are separated by a hairbreadth, where success brings unlimited power but a single failure means death.<br/>Amazon: Overall 3.5 stars out 5, based on 1,369 reviews<br/>Print Length: 604 pages<br/>Publisher: Henry Holt and Co. (April 1, 2010)</p>

We are often limited in what we think is possible; so it is.</p> <p>Let's investigate the field of subtle energy and create infinite possibilities that celebrate this last month of summer. We will exercise our wise souls and expand our consciousness through inspired conversation and intuitive exploration.</p> <p>We will share best practices, energetic exercises, and play-full ways to bloom in a whole new way for the fall.</p> <p>Great women, food, and soul-inspired experiences await.</p> <p>The field awaits . . . let's play.</p>

V<p>TurnON: [turn{on}]  </p> <p><br/>verb (something that happens in the body)</p> <p>To raise the body heat, leaving the individual feeling as though they may perspire</p> <p>To feel tingles in random parts of the body, letting the individual know those parts are awake</p> <p>To encounter cheeks getting flushed, often leaving the individual feel seen</p> <p>To ignite, as to feel more alive and alert</p> <p>TurnON occurs from many different things. Maybe you saw someone you thought was cute. Maybe you had an inappropriate thought cross your mind.</p> <p>Maybe you saw something that inspired or even pissed you off. Many things/people/conversations leave us with this ignited feeling in our body. (yes, deep down we all like the feeling of TurnON!) You know it's TurnON because it ignites -- as though your body is giving you a cue, shouting out "I'm ALIVE in here"!</p> <p>TurnON leaves you feeling more alert, ignited and happy.</p> <p>At OneTaste, we believe TurnON is the ignition that leads to a more of what we really want in life. We believe it is the first step to knowing what is possible.</p> <p>So, we started an evening event designed specifically to give people the opportunity to feel TurnON in themselves. (p.s., it's totally PG-13) It's an evening where, through only talking, we begin to experience these exhilarating, normal, often ignored feelings -- referred to as TurnON. A room of people (cool, fun people) engage in honest, humorous, playful conversation around topics we mostly only consider having in our head.</p> <p>TurnOn leads to authenticity and authenticity leads to the kind of connection we hope for around the globe.</p> <p>The evening leaves you invigorated, happy and inspired. We are meant to live TurnedON.</p> <p><i><br/></i></p> <p><i>Details:</i><br/>Singles &amp; Couples Welcome<br/>This event is $10</p> <p> </p>

They were a punk band when they started in Toronto more than a decade ago, and they've remained a punk band even as they've ascended to career heights that their younger selves never could've imagined</p> <p>...</p> <p>Musically, Glass Boys [new album] carries echoes of some of the more ragged and adventurous bands from America\u2019s punk past (Husker Du, Dinosaur Jr.), but it also has some of the anthemic charge of the Who and the guttural intensity of Negative Approach. Singer Damian Abraham still growls like a demon, but he\u2019s found more range and depth in his bark."</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/c/3/2/600_371444082.jpeg" /></p>

Bring plenty of business cards!  We appreciate knowing at least a day in advance if a visitor is coming, to make certain we can accommodate everyone.  There is a fee of $25 per person which includes an outstanding buffet luncheon with meat as well as vegetarian entrees.  See ya all then!</p>

(Members with a history of no-shows or last minute cancellations will be removed from my future invitation and event lists).</b></p> <p>Should you plan to arrive later than the scheduled time, please mention it along with your RSVPs, but keep in mind that if you are more than a half hour late, you may lose your spot to a waiting list member. Also note that you may or may not be able to play beyond one hour depending on how busy the courts are.</p> <p>Members who are on the waiting list are welcome to come out and check to see if there are spaces available around 7:00 since we normally play until about 9 or 9:30. Priority will be applied according to the order of your RSVP.</p> <p>Rain cancel, unless the courts have had some time to dry.</p> <p>We appreciate everyone's contributions of tennis balls.</p> <p>Thanks!

V<p>Startup Finance: Valuation</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/2/event_100045522.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>About:</b> Learn how to value a startup.</p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core. Valuation makes or breaks a company. It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job.

But they didn't start that way.</p> <p>All big businesses started small by definition. And when small, they succeeded when they discovered new value they could create for a targeted audience who shared a common pain or passion.  This is exactly the same process a startup entrepreneur must follow to be successful.</p> <p>As a startup or an enterprise, you need to practice focused value discovery.</p> <p>In this session, learn how to Zoom into narrowly defined customer segments in order to find new opportunities; in other words how to start small to go big.</p> <p>Aaron will introduce the Customer Zoom tool and discuss:- How to define and prioritize Customer Zooms</p> <p>- How to hypothesize, test and validate Customer Zooms</p> <p>- Enterprise Case Studies</p> <p>Participants will leave ready to go to work and as an added bonus, will receive the Moves the Needle Customer Zoom tool to help define their market segments. </p> <p><b>About Aaron Eden</b></p> <p>For more than 15 years, Aaron has utilized his passion for innovation, entrepreneurship and product management to start over 10 small businesses in industries ranging from information technology, real estate, online continuing education, family entertainment and business consulting. </p> <p>Additionally, he has a broad background focused on business intelligence and product management in the public, private and government sectors.</p> <p><b>About The UnConference</b></p> <p>We'll start this month's event UnConference style with Lean Startup Circle members sharing their knowledge in open spaces. Last month we had sessions such as:</p> <p>\u2022 Laura Klein, author of UX for Lean Startups - Q&amp;A</p> <p>\u2022 David Bland\ufeff, Principle Advisor at Neo - What do I do with this custdev data?</p> <p>\u2022 Gagan Biyani &amp; Morgan Springer\ufeff, founders of Sprig - Q&amp;A</p> <p>\u2022 \ufeffAlex Cowan\ufeff, author of Starting a Tech Business - \ufeffStoryboarding\ufeff</p> <p>\u2022 \ufeffMair Dundon\ufeff, UX Facilitator at QuietAction - Self Persona Workshop</p> <p>\u2022 \ufeffJacob Esparza\ufeff, CEO of Making Friends - Lessons Learned from Steve Blank's Lean Launch Pad</p> <p>\ufeffAnyone can pitch a session to:</p> <p>\u2022 Share their knowledge</p> <p>\u2022 Discuss a topic</p> <p>\u2022 Ask for help</p> <p>\u2022 NO PITCHES OR SOLICITATIONS!</p> <p>&lt;i style="font-size : 16px"&gt;Beer, (real non-pizza based) food, and a good hang with great people is included thanks to the price tag.

V<p>Startup Finance: Valuation</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/2/event_100045522.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>About:</b> Learn how to value a startup.</p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core. Valuation makes or breaks a company. It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job. This class is a must for all entrepreneurs.

V<p>Hello SF Language Lovers!</p> <p>Last month's meetup was a success. We're happy to welcome you again at the Hotel Rex!</p> <p>Come to speak in a language you are learning with native speakers, find a language-exchange partner, and/or share your native language and culture with people who are learning.</p> <p>ONE DRINK MINIMUM - This is a free group, which is great, but we do have to keep our venues welcoming us back. This means your minimum contribution is to buy yourself one drink or appetizer. Also, please do not forget to leave a TIP for the bartenders.</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you all soon!</p> <p>Julia&amp;Jessie</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aps: this meetup is now scheduled for every 3rd Wednesdays of the month, save the date!</p> <p> </p>

V<p>Carbon Five and Autodesk have partnered up to create the Sum of the Parts Speaker series. We want to bring great speakers from different corners of our world to share their ideas and experiences with the Bay Area development and design community. </p> <p>We believe that solving murky design problems often involves a crazy cocktail of people, talent, circumstance, data, and a good chunk of courage. We are inviting innovative people to talk candidly about the hard problems they\u2019ve faced and how they have succeeded. We also want to extend the invitation to others in San Francisco to be part of the conversation.</p> <p>Please join us in welcoming Leah Buley to talk about her experience as a UX designer at both big companies and small.</p>

V<p>Like masterpieces of art, music, and literature, great mathematical theorems are creative milestones, works of genius destined to last forever. Now William Dunham gives them the attention they deserve.<br/>Dunham places each theorem within its historical context and explores the very human and often turbulent life of the creator \u2014 from Archimedes, the absentminded theoretician whose absorption in his work often precluded eating or bathing, to Gerolamo Cardano, the sixteenth-century mathematician whose accomplishments flourished despite a bizarre array of misadventures, to the paranoid genius of modern times, Georg Cantor. He also provides step-by-step proofs for the theorems, each easily accessible to readers with no more than a knowledge of high school mathematics.</p>

V<p>Please join me at the Jazz on the Plazz in downtown Los Gatos when this FREE Wednesday Summer Jazz Series (<a href="http://jazzontheplazz.com/2014-artists/" class="linkified">http://jazzontheplazz.com/2014-artists/</a>) welcomes our Bay Area favorite Jazz duo, Tuck &amp; Patti.</p> <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCKUenysEe0" class="embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCKUenysEe0</a></p> <p>I recommend a parking space in front of the Coldwell Banker office at the corner of Highway 9 and N Santa Cruz Ave.  It\u2019s a short walk from  there to the Plaza park.</p> <p>Since it\u2019s rather difficult to find each other in a crowded public park, <b>I'll make the following meetup windows for this event:</b></p> <p><b>6 PM</b>: I will try to meet up with some of you in front of Los Gatos Coffee Roasting, and I'll be wearing the Meetup badge. </p> <p><b>6:20 PM:</b> If you miss the 6 PM window, but can make it to the park before the show, come to the white-chair reservation sign up table which is located to the left of the stage. I'll be wearing the Meetup badge. </p> <p><b>During the intermission:</b> If you come to the concert after it started, then meet me During the intermission at the white-chair reservation sign up table which is located to the left of the stage. I'll be wearing the Meetup badge. </p> <p>There is NO GUARANTEE WE CAN SIT TOGETHER.  </p> <p>PLEASE come to this event primarily to ENJOY the music in a free public concert in the park.  Those who come should not expect no one to reserve the seat for them, but to go ahead and get there early enough to stake own seating.  </p> <p>You can also buy the seat in the white reserved chair section by going up to the registration table.  </p> <p><b>At the end of the concert</b>, we'll all meet at the white-chair reservation sign up table which is located to the left of the stage. I'll be wearing the Meetup badge.  Then some of us can go to the optional dinner at a nearby healthy Mexican restaurant Andale's.</p>

V<p>Maptime is, rather literally, time for mapmaking. Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.</p> <p>This open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge offers intentional support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.</p> <p>Inspiration for Maptime comes from both hack nights and knitting circles. Both are models of spaces for people to create and learn together. Our goal is to provide this space with an open heart and without pretension. You can bring your own projects to work on, or just hang out and socialize or ask questions. Some people are experts, and some people are just getting started, but all of us are learning, so why not do it together?</p> <p>Maptime is hands-on, so don't forget to bring your laptop!</p> <p>We also have plenty of bike parking upstairs, so no need to leave your bike at street level.</p> <p><br/>For more information about Maptime, visit <a href="http://maptime.io">maptime.io</a>. Also, follow us on twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/MaptimeSF">@MaptimeSF</a>.</p>

V<p>4v4 pickup (4 simultaneous games if there are enough folks). First session begins at 7pm. Each session is one hour long. Teams are capped at 5 per side to ensure playing time for folks. Substitutions are enforced by the facilitator every 2 minutes so playing time is even spread evenly and everyone can just focus on having fun playing rather than worry about who's going to come out to make room for them. :)</p> <p>The vibe is laid back and fun. Like all SoccerFours sessions, teams are made up at the field, and scores aren't kept. There are no leagues. It's just organized pickup soccer run by a facilitator. $7/person for the session. RSVP here and bring cash to the field or sign up on our main site if you'd like. (If the slots here are full, try our main site to see if there are any left.)</p> <p>Let's have some fun! :)</p>

V<p>BOOK INFORMATION</p> <p><b>Date:</b> August 20, 2014<br/><b>Meeting Location:</b> Emeryville<br/><b>Title:</b> <i>The Federalist</i> by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay<br/><b>Genre:</b> Nonfiction \u2013 Political History<br/><b>Year of Publication:</b> 1787 to 1788<br/><b>Approximate Page Count:</b> 480 pages<br/><b>Summary:</b> After signing its Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, the United States of America functioned under a government created by the Articles of Confederation, which would later prove to be flawed and lead to the drafting of the United States Constitution in 1787 that many feared was too radical. In response, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, all under the pen name \u201cPublius,\u201d wrote a total of 85 essays that argued the strengths and merits of the new Constitution, covering topics such as the rationale for a stronger federal government and the rules specific to the government\u2019s legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Without the support of these persuasive and historically important essays, collectively known as the Federalist Papers, or simply the Federalist, the Constitution most likely would not have been ratified and the United States might not have survived as a nation.<br/><b>Suggested by:</b> Anthony</p> <p>----------</p> <p>DISCUSSION VOLUNTEER</p> <p>As this book is an Organizer's Pick, Anthony will present brief biographies of the three authors, share facts of interest about the Federalist as a whole, and lead the discussion with questions.</p> <p>----------</p> <p>ALTERNATE SOURCE</p> <p>Given the length of this book and how I underestimated the effort that may be required to read it all, I am providing you with the following link where you can find a summary for each of the 85 Federalist essays. You can choose to read the summaries instead of the book, which should still give you enough information to consider for the discussion.</p> <p><a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/the-federalist-papers/study-guide/short-summary/"><a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/the-federalist-papers/study-guide/short-summary/" class="linkified">http://www.gradesaver.com/the-federalist-papers/study-guide/short-summary/</a></a></p> <p>----------</p> <p>LAST UPDATE: June 15, 2014</p>

V<p>Are humans (even atheists) rational creatures? </p> <p>Why do people vote against their own best interests?</p> <p>Why do they imagine and worship non-material, non-empirical phantasms? </p> <p>How effective and accurate is human higher-order consciousness, the cognitive features that (theoretically) differentiate us from other animals? </p> <p>Science has some answers, but the implications are decidedly uncomfortable. When the objective evidence conflicts with beliefs, when your pre-frontal cortex (PFC) disagrees with your amygdala, what do you do? Let's use our PFCs and amygdalas to discuss and evaluate the science investigating the functions of our PFCs and amygdalas.</p> <p>Feel free to arrive early and have dinner at the restaurant. The presentation and Q&amp;A should be about an hour (starting at 7pm) then mingle with your fellow atheists after the meeting.</p> <p>Look for us in the back banquet room</p> <p>See you there!</p>

Don't forget to bring your own chair or blanket as well as some snacks - or an entire meal from a nearby downtown restaurant!</p> <p><b>Tonight's movie:</b></p> <p><b>Airplane!</b> -This spoof of the Airport series of disaster movies relies on hilarious sight gags, groan-inducing dialogue, and deadpan acting \u2014 a comedy style has been imitated for the past two decades. Alcoholic pilot Ted Striker has to land the plane after the captain gets food poisoning. Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack have to talk him down. Leslie Nielsen launches a career as slapstick leading man. Please, don\u2019t call him Shirley.</p> <p><b><a href="http://sjdowntown.com/starlight./"><a href="http://sjdowntown.com/starlight./" class="linkified">http://sjdowntown.com/starlight./</a></a></b></p> <p><b>The Foodie Part:</b> There are a lot of different places to eat in the Market Square. Lots of variety to choose from. We will meet at the coffee place at 7 pm and check out the food places prior to the movie. Once we have our food we will saunter over to the area where they will have the movie and settle in.</p> <p> </p>

V<p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p><br/>In this session you will start with a pile of hardware and build a working, cloud-enabled device from the ground up. </p> <p>Essential skills will be presented:</p> <p>\u2022 Building the device from raw hardware</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Writing software for the Raspberry PI and the Cloud</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Mono and C# on the device</p> <p>\u2022 Node.js in the cloud</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/7/c/600_381834652.jpeg" /></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>The Gold Rush is here</b></p> <p>Machine-to-machine (M2M) computing and Internet of Things (IoT) is fast becoming a technology that all developers and architects need to embrace. Numerous studies suggest a coming world of tens of billions of devices (a half-dozen for every human on earth) by 2020 (bit.ly/M2qBII). One reason this is happening is because it has never been easier for garage tinkerers and hobbyists to prototype a consumer or commercial device for later manufacture and sale. Getting started with both the hardware and software is incredibly inexpensive. For less than $100, you can order an Arduino or a Raspberry PI.</p> <p><br/><b>Understanding the Cloud</b></p> <p>These devices rarely have value unless they\u2019re connected to something else, perhaps a cloud back end that receives data and sends commands. But connecting to, communicating with and managing these devices from an application running in the cloud presents some special challenges. The sheer number of devices, as well as their limited battery life and bandwidth, forces companies developer to carefully consider all options.</p> <p>In this session we will review the landscape and take a close look on the role of cloud computing with respect to the world of M2M and IoT. We will address key issues, such as bandwidth and security. We will debunk the myth that IPv6 and virtual private networks (VPNs) are simple, efficient, and secure, and will propose some specific recommendations for using the Cloud to solve these challenges. We will look at some specific examples using the Arduino and the Raspberry PI.</p> <p><b>The building of a working product - Soup to Nuts</b></p> <p>We will also present \u201cSmartDoor,\u201d where we really roll up our sleeves, both from a hardware and software point of view and learn what it takes to truly embrace this new computing paradigm. SmartDoor and is the reference IoT product we will build from the ground up, making it possible for any one to start embracing the Internet of Things. </p> <p><b>Soldering a doorbell to the device</b></p> <p>If you look closely, you will see a doorbell and a camera on top of a PI device. The idea is that someone arrives on your doorstep and rings your doorbell. Once the doorbell is pressed a photo is automatically taken. This photo is then forwarded to a mobile device as a push notification message with a hyperlink to the image taken of the person at your doorstep. This invention was inspired by the need to know who is ringing your doorbell, even if you\u2019re not home.</p> <p><b>What we will build</b></p> <p>We will begin by illustrating exactly how to purchase and put together the raw hardware. But software rules the world, and that\u2019s where a bulk of the presentation will focus. Once the hardware is built, we will build software that runs on the device itself, as well as software that runs in the cloud. The code will need to be able to take a picture and upload it to the cloud. From there, a push notification will need to be sent to the appropriate mobile device(s), indicating that someone has pressed the doorbell, and that the photo is available. Because of the ambitious nature of this project we will provide a number of blog posts to support the work and provide the needed details.</p> <p><b>Mono and C# </b></p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/f/e/600_381836062.jpeg" /></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aOn the Raspberry PI we will install and run Mono, which is a free and open source project led by Xamarin (formerly by Novell) that provides a .NET Framework-compatible set of tools including, among others, a C# compiler and a Common Language Runtime. The beauty of Mono is that it allows us to write .Net code compiled on Windows and run it unchanged on the Raspberry PI. In our case, we will take a photo and upload it to Windows Azure storage. We will expand the code base further, supporting the ability to send a push notifications to a Windows Phone.</p> <p><b>Node.js running in the cloud</b></p> <p>In the cloud we will work with Node.js, which will enable the PI to send photos directly to cloud storage.</p> <p><b>The Raw Hardware</b></p> <p>Getting the hardware together is really straightforward because almost all of it is available in a single Raspberry PI kit. This kit is called Canakit and can be found at <a href="http://www.canakit.com/" class="linkified">http://www.canakit.com/</a>. The kit contains a few really useful things to get to get our IoT device built, including a system Board, A/C Adapter, GPIO Breakout, Bread Board, Bread Board wires, assorted resisters and LEDs. You will also need an external monitor, keyboard and mouse so you can configure and test the Raspberry PI. In addition to the Canakit, you will need two more things \u2013 a regular doorbell and a Raspberry PI compatible camera, both of which are easily purchased.</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/3/a/600_381834842.jpeg" /></p> <p>More to come...</p> <p><b>Bruno Terkaly</b></p> <p>Bruno is a Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft with the objective to enable the development of industry leading applications and services across devices. He is responsible for driving the top cloud and mobile opportunities across the United States and beyond from a technology enablement perspective. He helps partners bring their applications to market by providing architectural guidance and deep technical engagement during the ISV\u2019s evaluation, development, and deployment. In addition, Bruno works closely with the cloud and mobile engineering groups, providing feedback and influencing the roadmap.</p> <p><b>Steven Edouard</b></p> <p>Steven Edouard is a Developer Evangelist and full-time hacker at Microsoft. Before moving to the bay he worked on the.NET runtime team as a Software Test Engineer delivering products like .NET 4.5 and .NET Native Compilation. Now his passion resides in exciting people on the limitless potentials of cloud computing services through engaging technical demonstrations, online content and presentations.</p> <p><b>More Info</b></p> <p>By 2020 nearly every human on earth will be connected to about six devices. It has never been more economical or easy for the average person to prototype and produce a consumer or commercial device manufacture and sale. For less than $100, devices like the Arduino or Raspberry Pi provides you a microcontroller fitted with a small CPU, memory, and storage. Moreover, there is a plethora of expansion boards that plug into these devices, such as motor controls, GPS, Ethernet, LCD displays, sensors, actuators and more. These tiny devices come equipped with either a proprietary operating system or GNU/Linux with up to 512MB or RAM.</p> <p>But these devices rarely have value unless they are connected to a cloud service on the backend. The cloud provides many useful services, including data analysis, issuing commands to control the device, security, provisioning, and management.</p> <p>This talk will focus on the key considerations that companies, entrepreneurs, and individuals will face when creating and supporting these devices at scale.</p> <p><b>Device Spectrum</b></p> <p>At the low end of the spectrum is the Arduino. The higher-end devices include the raspberry pi. A myriad of expansion boards can be attached to the small microcontrollers.</p> <p>What other capabilities with respect to CPU, memory, and storage?</p> <p>What expansion boards are available and what purpose do they serve?</p> <p><b>Device Software</b></p> <p>A variety of operating systems are supported on these devices. Programming tools and compilers make it possible to create custom software that run on these devices.</p> <p>What are the capabilities of these operating systems in terms of storage, memory, processing speed, and networking?</p> <p>What type of programming tools are available?</p> <p>What programming languages are supported in the device itself?</p> <p><b>Cloud Backend</b></p> <p>The cloud provides many useful services for these devices in a connected world.</p> <p>What role does the cloud play with respect to security?</p> <p>Which networking connectivity solutions that should be considered for device-to-cloud communication?</p> <p>How does the cloud help alleviate bandwidth challenges and minimize power consumption on the device?</p> <p>What are the four patterns for device to cloud service message communication?</p> <p><b>Choosing a device </b></p> <p><i>Selecting CPU, memory, and storage</i></p> <p>At the low end of the spectrum is the Arduino with only 4K of memory. The raspberry pie represents the higher end of the spectrum, running a full-blown version of Linux.</p> <p><i>Expanding device capabilities</i></p> <p>The ability to expand your device capabilities is astounding. You can connect everything from motor controls to infrared remote control, GPS, wireless networking, home automation to sensor and beyond.</p> <p>Even if you limit yourself to look in all sensors, there is remarkable variety: Acoustic, sound, vibration, Automotive, transportation, Chemical, Electric current, electric potential, magnetic, radio, Environment, weather, moisture, humidity, Flow, fluid velocity, Ionizing radiation, subatomic particles, Navigation instruments, Position, angle, displacement, distance, speed, acceleration, Optical, light, imaging, photon, Pressure, Force, density, level, Thermal, heat, temperature, Proximity, presence</p> <p><b>Writing software for your device</b></p> <p><br/>Most of these devices come pre-equipped with some type of operating system, and support for programming tools. Many of these devices are even capable of running a Web server or supporting an external display that can provide a user interface for interaction</p> <p><br/><i>Programming tools, compilers and languages</i></p> <p><br/>Software developers work with code editors and compilers to create executables that run on the device. This presentation will provide an overview about what\u2019s available and what makes sense given specific use case scenarios. Practically all popular languages are supported on these devices. It is even possible to write code with C# on top of Mono running on Linux, for example.</p> <p><i>Client connectivity to the cloud</i></p> <p><br/>How a client device connects it to the cloud is important. Choosing an efficient communication protocol, including both networking and messaging is critical, as it affects performance, power consumption, and security.</p> <p><b>Microsoft Azure \u2013 an ideal cloud back-end for IoT devices</b></p> <p><br/>Special consideration must be given to the cloud backend. Microsoft Azure is ideally suited because of its support for the Service Bus, which provides a hosted, secure, and widely available infrastructure for widespread communication, large-scale event distribution, naming, and service publishing.</p> <p><i>Addressability and network connectivity</i></p> <p><br/>Virtual private networks fail miserably in providing a simple, efficient, and secure way to connect a client device to the cloud. Many of these devices are not under direct physical control, so making them part of a virtual network dramatically compromises security.</p> <p>Typical HTTP request response architectures drains battery life on devices. Moreover, the payload associated with the request/response payload is unnecessarily huge and can be ridiculously wasteful.</p> <p>Finally, most, if not all of these devices sit behind a network address translation layer, posing a big problem for addressability and connectivity. The Microsoft Azure Service Bus greatly simplifies connectivity acting as a relay service, and serving as a proxy for the cloud backend.</p> <p><i>Scalabilty, Storage, Big Data, Web Services<br/></i></p> <p>One of the most important aspects of the cloud is its ability to scale on demand. The amount of devices put into production is generally unknown in the beginning and can change dramatically throughout the lifecycle of the devices in the field. Having the capability to scale as needed, whether scaling up or scaling down, is critical.</p> <p>The amount of data that devices can generate staggering. Having a storage infrastructure that provides the necessary security, scale, and support for various data formats is mandatory. Microsoft Azure supports traditional blobs, key-value, column family, graph, relational, and document stores.</p> <p>The ability to analyze this data is also critically important. Support for Hadoop, reporting and data analytics is an essential part of the cloud backend. I signing probability to predictions, as well as finding patterns is an important part of the infrastructure needed to support these data producing devices.</p> <p>The cloud backend also needs to support a variety of operating systems, languages and open-source software. Microsoft Azure supports everything from Python to C#, Node.js, C/C++, as well as a variety of functional languages typically used in machine learning scenarios.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p><br/>This abstracts reflects the content that will be presented during our talk. It provides a comprehensive deep dive into the challenges and solutions for individuals and companies looking to enter the brave new world of Machine to Machine computing or the Internet of Things. The discussion will address the needs of the executive decision-makers, architects, software developers, and hardware enthusiasts. Real-life examples will be brought into the discussion as well as concrete recommendations and examples.</p>

V<p>4v4 pickup (4 simultaneous games if there are enough folks). Second session begins at 8pm. Each session is one hour long. Teams are capped at 5 per side to ensure playing time for folks. Substitutions are enforced by the facilitator every 2 minutes so playing time is even spread evenly and everyone can just focus on having fun playing rather than worry about who's going to come out to make room for them. :)</p> <p>The vibe is laid back and fun. Like all SoccerFours sessions, teams are made up at the field, and scores aren't kept. There are no leagues. It's just organized pickup soccer run by a facilitator. $6/person for the session. RSVP here and bring cash to the field or sign up on our main site if you'd like. (If the slots here are full, try our main site to see if there are any left.)</p> <p>Let's have some fun! :)</p>

The place to meet is the MP SUMMIT, not any trailhead. 2. You may have your own pace in ascending, so, start at the time with your defined pace.

We welcome anyone to attend a GoRampUp! meeting, once, for free as our guest, so you can learn what the innovative GoRampUp! business-networking experience is all about. Note, we are not able to give you a free meeting at more than one of our many locations.</p> <p>YOU MUST obtain a free-access GoRampUp! Golden ticket by registering for a specific meeting at<a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar/"><a href="http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/" class="linkified">http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/</a></a>. This ticket must be presented at your complimentary meeting for you to gain admittance. Without this ticket you will, unfortunately, be declined access to our innovative and exclusive business-networking meeting. WITH a GoRampUp! Golden Ticket, you will be welcomed with open arms!</p> <p>It can be too difficult to attract new clients. We help you fix that! We're a business-impact community. We're informal and fun, yet, by design, we're extremely effective!</p> <p>We help people who work for a living to get a much greater payoff from working. We do this in three specific ways under our three CoreSuccess Platforms: 1) We help you move toward mastery with business-networking, 2) We help you move toward mastery with business performance, and, 3) We help you move toward mastery with personal development.</p> <p>How do we deliver on this promise to our community members? Each month we conduct dozens of business-networking meetings in more than a dozen cities in the SF Bay Area. A member may attend all of our "OpenConnect" business-networking meetings. And our members are welcome and encouraged to attend any and all of these meetings and locations.</p> <p>Each month we introduce and emphasize a learning and development subject under each of our three CoreSuccess Platforms. For each of the three learning and development subjects that we introduce and emphasize each month, we give you four different ways to learn it: We produce written learning guides, video learning guides, audio learning guide, and we cover the subjects as 15-to-20-minute mini-workshops inside of our 60-minute business-networking meetings. There's no registration or initiation fee to join. Membership in GoRampUp! is month to month. You enroll when you like, even mid-month, and you depart when you like.</p> <p>Be sure to see our website to learn about <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/growrampup">our generous enrollment incentives</a></p> <p>Also, be sure to learn about our <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/norisk">100-Satisfaction Money-Back Guarantee</a></p> <p>Would you care to come to this meeting, at no cost, to see if there\u2019s business-value for you?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">Free-Meeting Guest-RSVP and Golden Ticket Request</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">View complete meeting details</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/invite">Invite a Buddy to join you</a></p> <p>One last thing: You REALLY should check out actual testimonial videos by our members: <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/why">See them here</a></p> <p>This page was created to produce awareness of our event.

V<p>After a successful first Meetup, I am happy to announce that the second Fusion 360 Meetup is happening Thursday, August 21st.  This event will again be hosted at Pier 9 with a few minor changes to the agenda. We will again be giving shop tours, showing off projects from local users and provide live software demonstration from the Fusion 360 product team, but this time I would like <b>YOU</b> to provide your top questions before the event so that we can be prepared to demonstrate the solutions for you. </p> <p>Also, if any of you are interested in presenting your projects and work, please let me know!</p> <p> There will be beer and pizza (in that order) before and during the presentations.  Like last time, space is tight so attendance is limited.</p>

V<p>Meet Up: This is where we meet up and get to know one another! Look each other in the eye and celebrate each other for doing the work.</p> <p><br/>Story Page: Bring a one page (maximum) outline answering these questions about your story:<br/>1) What is the beginning of your story?<br/>2) What is the middle of your story?<br/>3) What is the ending of your story?<br/>*Even if you are not sure, do your best to answer in the best way possible, in one page. This will help the group get an idea of what you are working on and we will be able to give better feedback.</p> <p>Story Issue: Each person will state one issue they are experiencing while working on their story. Then, as a group, we will brainstorm ways to make it a non-issue.</p> <p><br/>Mix N'Mingle: The final half hour is to talk more amongst ourselves, share ideas, share strategies, share resources, share any additional work.</p> <p>Important Note: This group is based on the values of non-judgement and respect.</p> <p>Suggested Donation: There will be a tip jar at the meeting. A donation of $2-$5 is greatly appreciated and will be used for the meetup site maintenance fee and to purchase refreshments/supplies for each meeting. Thanks!</p>

V<p>IMUG is proud to once again partner with GALA on a local networking evening!  Come for a tempting buffet, cash bar and fine conversation with your GILT industry friends and colleagues in the lounge at Xahn on Castro Street in Mountain View.</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/7/b/a/600_150239322.jpeg" /></p> <p><i>The above photo shows some of the happy 42 attendees at the last GALA-IMUG event, in August 2012.</i></p> <p><br/><b>GALA local networking events are intended as relaxed, non-commercial gatherings.</b> This is one of the many ways GALA carries out its mission to bring the industry together to share information, foster innovation among GALA members and the industry as a whole, and to offer clients collaborative value.</p> <p><b>The Globalization and Localization Association</b> (GALA) is the world's largest trade association for the language industry with over 400 member companies in more than 50 countries. As a non-profit organization, we provide resources, education, advocacy, and research for thousands of global companies. GALA's mission is to support our members and the language industry by creating communities, championing standards, sharing knowledge, and advancing technology. For more information: <a href="http://www.gala-global.org">www.gala-global.org</a></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a<b>$5 per person</b> is required from members and nonmembers for this event, for the food buffet. <i>Drinks will be additional.</i> You can pay in advance via PayPal when you RSVP. ($5 does not cover all food costs. IMUG is paying the balance.) </p> <p><b>Please RSVP via Meetup</b> to help us order enough food, prepare for fast entrance and other details. It's OK to RSVP right up to the last minute, as that will help us ensure enough food for everyone! <a href="http://events.imug.org/" class="linkified">http://events.imug.org/</a></p> <p><b>The hashtag for IMUG events is #imug408.</b> Yes, we'll be just into area code 650 this time.

V<p>This is such a beautiful place to hike when the sun is going down. Join us for this 5 mile loop up Brushy Peak and enjoy the summer sunset colors on the gorgeous rolling hills. It's a moderate hike up, and worth it for the great views of the Livermore Valley and Altamont windmills.</p> <p>The hike is just short of 2 hours. Be sure to bring plenty of water. <i>Keep in mind it can get a little windy out there, so you might want to bring a light jacket if it's a cool evening. </i></p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/c/5/4/600_380107252.jpeg" /></p>

V<p>Folks,</p> <p>Anybody up for a camping run through Northern California?</p> <p><b>Not for Newbies!   Minimum of 10 years riding experience.  Route will include high speed highway runs allowing for flowing with traffic in the left lane at between 70 to 85MPH with bursts up to 90MPH, backroads with fast sweeping curves and mountain twisties.</b></p> <p>Once we get critical mass, I'll make camping reservations for which each rider will pony up at the outset of the ride.</p> <p>Also, if we get over 8 riders, I'd be looking for a sweep, hopefully with a Sena Bluetooth radio.</p> <p>\u000a\u000a<b>~RAIN CANCELS~</b></p> <p>\u2022 <b>When:</b> <b>Sat 08/22/14</b>, <b>A</b><b>rrive by 06:30AM</b> - <b>KSU @ 07:00AM</b></p> <p>\u2022 <b>Where:</b> Meet at Starbucks 6050 Johnson Drive Pleasanton, CA 94588 </p> <p>\u2022 <b>Route:</b> <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/yI0BQ">General Route (Subject to minor changes)</a></p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/0/2/e/600_379444142.jpeg" /></p> <p>Accommodations will be Camping</p> <p><br/>1st Night: Lake Almanor, Chester, CA</p> <p>2nd Night: Crater Lake National Park, OR</p> <p>3rd Night: Redwoods River Resort, Leggett, CA</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/2/0/4/600_379444612.jpeg" /></p> <p>~ Allow for time to arrive with a <b>Full Gas Tank!</b></p> <p>~Safety talk 10 minutes before KSU time, <b>must attend talk to go on ride.<br/></b> ~ Ride within your comfort zone and leave room for bad karma.<br/>~ I may pass slower traffic when it's safe.

V<p>Speaker: Paul Duan</p> <p>With data science, we\u2019re able to build increasingly complex systems at scale that not only provide insights but also are able to offer actionable predictions. If the tech sector is using data science to break open consumer and enterprise markets, we have to ask ourselves: why haven\u2019t we seen the same disruption in solving social challenges? Come hear Bayes Impact's Chief Scientist Paul Duan talk about how our fellows are using data science to solve the world's toughest problems.</p> <p>Paul Duan is the Chief Scientist at Bayes Impact. Formerly lead data scientist at Eventbrite, he has been profiled in the Wall Street Journal, Kaggle, and Healthcare Data Consortium.</p>

V<p>We are excited to announce we are helping promote Dan Ariely &amp; Irrational Labs\u2019 StartupOnomics. This behavioral economics summit is 2.5 days and 2 nights of engaging, interactive lectures and workshop sessions. At the end of the weekend, teams will walk away knowing how to move the needle on their biggest customer problems and with tangible ideas to immediately test and implement.  </p> <p>\u000a\u000a<a href="http://startuponomics.com/">StartupOnomics</a> will accept only 25 teams, with a requirement to bring 2 people per team accepted. This is intended to create an <b>immersive and intimate discussion environment with the speakers and mentors.</b></p> <p>\u000a\u000aJust for the SF Fintech Meetup</p> <p><br/>We have got an extended deadline to apply only for our group from July 10th to July 13th. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?usp=drive_web&amp;formkey=dDZ1TkUyeHk3QmFCZmpCcGpXSENWdGc6MA#gid=0">You can use this link to apply up until Sunday July 13th</a></p> <p>If you are in Fin-tech and solving something related to financial inclusion, <b>they will likely be able to subsidize the fee for your company.</b></p> <p><br/><b>Details of Event </b></p> <p>The 4th annual StartupOnomics will cover </p> <p>1) consumer financial decision making and </p> <p>2) healthy life choices. </p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aSpeakers include three of the field's leading experts in the psychology of our users: Dan Ariely (Duke University), Mike Norton (Harvard Business School), and Hal Hershfield (NYU Stern School of Business) and top experts specifically in healthy living: Brain Wansink (Cornell) and Gregg Rap (Menu engineer)</p> <p>Dan Ariely has authored three New York Times bestsellers and dozens of academic papers about the psychology of money. Brian Wansink is the leading researcher on behavior in relation to food choices. Mike looks at the intersection of time, money, and happiness and collected his insights in a new book "Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending." Hal looks at the role of emotions when we make tradeoffs between immediate pleasures (a slice of cake) and future costs (adding on extra pounds).</p> <p>StartupOnomics brings together TOP academics that study human behavior with the companies looking to change the world. It's literally the only place to catch the people who write the studies on decision making - and in one room. To reiterate (we are purposely emphatic) it is highly unusual for professors of this caliber to take a weekend out of their schedule to come and chat with companies. This is like getting a permit to raft the grand canyon, front row at the Masters or consecutive blue bird days in Tahoe - the chance to hangout with these guys together is something super special.</p> <p>Hot discussion topics include:<br/>\u2022 Product adoption and growth<br/>\u2022 Increasing addictive usage<br/>\u2022 Building loyal customers that love you<br/>\u2022 Payment strategies<br/>\u2022 Building a team that loves what they do<br/>\u2022 Measuring what matters<br/>\u2022 Testing approaches and best practices</p> <p>For more information visit <a href="http://www.startuponomics.com/" class="linkified">http://www.startuponomics.com/</a> or email [masked]. Please reach out with any questions</p>

"The Boys" have the only lead vocalist of any known Eagles act whose voice "nails" the distinctive sound of Don Henley, who was/is the heart and soul of the original band. Be prepared to hear all of the greatest hits from Take It Easy to Hotel California and even the newer smash country hit, How Long. The core of the band has been together since their school days, lending to the cohesive, note-for-note perfect re-creation of the original recordings by the legendary Eagles.</p>

V<p>Structure and Formation - From the Depths to the Shallows</p> <p>We are pleased to announce a special Meetup event, a collaboration of Silicon Valley Nexus, Helix, a project of the San Francisco Exploratorium, and Nature Gallery.</p> <p>Meet artist Cris Benton, geologist Naomi Marks, and science communicator Nicole Kurtz in this evening reception intended for adults that bridges Helix and the Silicon Valley Nexus at Nature Gallery.</p> <p>At Nature Gallery Cris will show his kite aerial photography of the South Bay's salt evaporation ponds and discuss the sublime structures formed through the processes of ecological transformation.</p> <p>At Helix, Naomi and Nicole discuss their work on Expedition 345 at Hess Deep Rift sampling the rapidly-formed rocks of the oceanic crust, offering an insight into the geological processes that form the structure of the Earth itself.</p> <p>Start at either venue - Helix is located at 316 State St. Los Altos; Nature Gallery is located at 296 State Street, Los Altos.  We will switch places mid-evening so you can attend the other talk first.  During the evening you will enjoy drinks and hors d'oeuvres and meet others interested in exploring the intersection of art, science, and technology.</p> <p>Helix by Exploratorium: <a href="http://www.helixlosaltos.org">www.helixlosaltos.org</a> </p> <p>Silicon Valley Nexus Meetup: <a href="http://svnexus.com/">svnexus.com</a> </p> <p>Nature Gallery: <a href="http://www.nature-gallery.com">www.nature-gallery.com</a> </p> <p>To learn more about Expedition 345: Hess Deep Plutonic Crust: <a href="http://joidesresolution.org/node/2738"><a href="http://joidesresolution.org/node/2738" class="linkified">http://joidesresolution.org/node/2738</a></a></p> <p>To learn more about Cris Benton and Saltscapes: <a href="https://heydaybooks.com/book/saltscapes/"><a href="https://heydaybooks.com/book/saltscapes/" class="linkified">https://heydaybooks.com/book/saltscapes/</a></a></p> <p>Cris Benton</p> <p>Cris Benton is a retired professor of architecture and former department chair at the University of California, Berkeley. His kite aerial photography in the South Bay began during a sabbatical year spent as artist in residence at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, and it has continued under special use permits from the Don Edwards National Wildlife Refuge and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The resulting images documenting the salt ponds have been shown at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Exploratorium, and the Coyote Point Museum, as well as conferences and art galleries.</p> <p>Nicole Kurtz</p> <p>Nicole is a science educator and was one of three education officers on Expedition 345. Nicole obtained her BFA in Medical Illustration from the Cleveland Institute of Art with a Minor in Fiber and Material Studies. Upon completion of her degree, she developed a thesis focused on the necessity of art in scientific discovery. Her techniques utilize skills of authoring, communicating, leading and designing scientific content and translating it for the lay audiences as well as the science community. On Expedition 345, she created visuals and animations as well as curricula to help science educators explain the significance of the voyage to diverse learning audiences.</p> <p>Naomi Marks</p> <p>Dr. Marks is a geologist who served as a metamorphic petrologist on Expedition 345: Hess Deep Plutonic Crust, undertaken by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program in December 2012-February 2013. She is a researcher in the Chemical and Material Sciences Division of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</p> <p>The event will be held on Friday August 22, 2014 6:00PM to 8:00PM at two venues:</p> <p>Nature Gallery, 296 State St., Los Altos, CA 94022</p> <p>Helix, 316 State St. Los Altos, CA 94022.</p>

V<p>from band website:</p> <p><br/>For the past 30 years, D.R.I. has been the epitome of the<br/>agressive, hardcore-punk thrash sound that we've all become<br/>accustomed to hearing. Throughout this time, they've been one of<br/>the few genuine underground bands to remain true to their pure<br/>punk roots. Still actively touring and recording, the only thing<br/>that may have changed is that they're a little older now, but<br/>time hasn't gotten the best of the Dirty Rotten Imbeciles.<br/>They're still thrashing just as hard, and just as loud as ever,<br/>continuing to overload our senses with the sound that is, and<br/>will always remain, uniquely D.R.I.</p>

V<p>Please join us on movie night for the warmly received, The Lunchbox.</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aWarm, affectionate, and sweet but not cloying, The Lunchbox is a clever crowd-pleaser from first-time director Ritesh Batra. A mistaken delivery in Mumbai's famously efficient lunchbox delivery system connects Saajan (Irfan Kahn), a lonely widower close to retirement, and Ila, an unhappy housewife. As they start exchanging notes through the daily lunchbox, gradually, their notes become little confessions about their loneliness, memories, regrets, fears, and even small joys.</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aIndia/France/Germany/USA 2013, 104 min. Color 2. 35: 1 English/Hindi Directed &amp; Written by Ritesh Batra</p> <p><br/> This event meets on the last Friday of the month, August 29th at 7:30 PM. The screening usually starts by 7:45. Snacks and drinks are provided.</p> <p><br/> </p> <p><br/>For further questions email Ronald at ronaldsframe at hotmail dot com</p>

V<p>From Wikipedia:<br/>Jack White is an American musician, singer-songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, designer, upholsterer, director, writer, and actor. On April 24, 2012, White released his debut solo album, Blunderbuss, which received wide critical acclaim.</p> <p>He has been ranked No. 70 on Rolling Stone's list of "The 100 Greatest Guitarists". White's popular and critical success with The White Stripes enabled him to collaborate as a solo artist with other renowned musicians, such as Beck, the Rolling Stones, Jeff Beck, Alicia Keys, Bob Dylan, Wanda Jackson, Electric Six, and Loretta Lynn, whose 2004 album Van Lear Rose he produced and performed on. In 2006, White became a founding member of the rock band the Raconteurs. In 2009, he became a founding member and drummer of his third commercially successful group, the Dead Weather. He was awarded the title of "Nashville Music City Ambassador" by the Nashville mayor Karl Dean in 2011. He is a board member of the Library of Congress' National Recording Preservation Foundation, a music historian, collector and philanthropist, as well as an advocate for analog technology and recording techniques.</p>

V<p>So this was in San Jose last year and this year it's in San Mateo. Last year was its first year in the US and it was pretty cool. They had a masquerade for each day of the convention and lots of stuff to check out. It's part con and part cultural festival. Not a whole lot of info up yet, but here's their site: <a href="http://www.japan-expo.org/" class="linkified">http://www.japan-expo.org/</a></p>

V<p>Every year the American Cancer Society holds its Bark For Life event in Golden Gate Park . This dog-friendly event raises money for cancer research. Unlike its other 1-2-or-3 day events, this is a short loop around the park, followed by a festival with games, vendors and a ceremony for survivors.  Please join our team.  Invite your family, friends, children, co-workers, etc.  This is definitely a more-the-better kind of event.</p> <p>Our team is called "DOG FRIENDLY MEETUP GROUPS" Please join by the link below. We are hoping to get members from Meetup groups all over the bay area. Last year a few of us participated on short notice and raised several hundred dollars. We're hoping that by planning ahead we can do better this year.</p> <p><a href="http://main.acsevents.org/site/TR/RelayForLife/BFLCY14CA?pg=entry&amp;fr_id=56173" class="linkified">http://main.acsevents.org/site/TR/RelayForLife/BFLCY14CA?pg=entry&amp;fr_id=56173</a></p> <p>Follow the link: Click "SIGN UP", Then "JOIN A WOOFPACK" and be part of the team. (or search for a participant, then type in meet) It cost $25 per dog, and they ask that each person fundraise to a minimum of $100.</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aPlease join the team first, then RSVP yes on the Meetup page.</p>

V<p>Lets have a two-day, three-round Diplomacy mini-con! Saturday, August 23 to Sunday, August 24th.</p> <p>Edi Birsan has conjured a space in Concord at the Todos Santos /Pacheco Plaza on Salvio between Grant and Mt. Diablo; walking distance from the BART Downtown Concord station.</p> <p><br/>We will be playing outside around the fountain and in the alcoves. </p> <p><br/>Adjacent to the plaza is an Italian restaurant and the Hop Grenade which is a micro-brew Beer joint plus tons of restaurants in walking distance."</p> <p>Your Tournament Director will be Andy Hull.</p> <p>Round 1: Saturday 10:30am - 4:30pm (6 hours)</p> <p>Round 2: Saturday 5:00pm - 11:00pm (6 hours)</p> <p>Round 3: Sunday 9:00am - 3:00pm (6 hours)</p> <p>Given that each round is going to be relatively short, each board will run it's own clock and we will use drop-dead timing. This is where there is no additional time for order-writing; all orders must be submitted prior to the end of the negotiation deadline.</p> <p>As is the ancient and noble way of our people, we're asking for volunteers willing and able to host any players traveling from outside the area and cart their sorry hides to and from the event. </p>

V<p>The starting spot is the new Lands End Lookout Visitor Center which is close to the Cliff House near the Sutro Baths. Our route includes Baker Beach, the Seacliff neighborhood, and Marshall Beach.<br/>(by the way, clothing is optional in Baker Beach.)</p> <p>Lunch is in Crissy Fields by Warming Hut. They have sandwiches and drinks.</p> <p>Length: it is 10 miles total; however, once we get to the bridge, there is an option to return back by public transportation (Bus/Taxi/Uber/Sidecar). I am leaning towards that so the hikes ends up being approx 5 miles.</p> <p>Dog: Dogs on leash are welcome</p>

V<p>Some of what you'll see on this hike... </p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/2/1/8/600_322405112.jpeg" /></p> <p> This will be about a 7+ mile hike w/ an elevation gain of approx 600'. Oh and very pretty. The rating is Pretty (for good views) and Easy-Moderate (for hiking). Obviously the rating depends on your condition. For me, I expect this one will be difficult  ;-)</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/4/2/600_322403362.jpeg" /></p> <p>An online 5 Star review had this to say... "Great place to: ride your bike, run, site see, critter watch, take in the natural beauty, make out!, reflect, skip rocks and get away from it all."</p> <p>That's enough for me - hike, enjoy the people and scenery, sip some vino - YES!</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/7/2/8/600_322402312.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/2/6/600_322406662.jpeg" /></p> <p>What To Bring:</p> <p>Vino! (and cups)</p> <p>Good Hiking Boots/shoes</p> <p>Layered clothing, hat, sunscreen</p> <p>1-2 liters of cold water (1/2 fill and refrigerate, then top w/ ice in the a.m.)</p> <p>Snacks for the vino/snack break</p> <p>Food for the potluck (sliced sandwiches, salads, meats/cheeses/breads/crackers, wraps, chicken, dried fruit/nuts/seeds, chips, dips, salsa,  - be creative.)   Sharing the meal is part of connecting w/ everyone.</p> <p>Drinks, drinks, drinks! Vino,  tea, juice, beer, - whatever whets your whistle.</p> <p>If you've been on any of my hikes you know what to expect - if you haven't, then be prepared for fun!</p> <p>$5 activity fee</p> <p>Your sense of humour is an absolute must!</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/a/c/600_322403212.jpeg" /></p> <p> Please note:</p> <p>There are no wineries in the park, sooooo bring those bottles!</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/b/1/a/600_322403322.jpeg" /></p> <p>There will be a vino/snack break along the hike, and later we'll stop at a picnic area for the potluck. </p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/7/e/6/600_323922982.jpeg" /></p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/4/a/8/600_323922152.jpeg" /></p> <p>&lt;a&gt;Directions&lt;/a&gt;:</p> <p>From Highway 101 in San Rafael, exit at N.

After the success the first time (2013) with over 2,000 people from all over the Bay Area in attendance, and rave reviews from the <a href="http://www.peaceintheparksf.org/partners/#sponsors">sponsors</a>, <a href="http://www.peaceintheparksf.org/performers/">performers</a> and <a href="http://www.peaceintheparksf.org/partners/">partners</a>, the community has called for it to become an annual event.</p> <p>On August 23rd, the 2nd annual festival will feature world music and visual artists; tai chi, hatha yoga; life-changer seminars, arts, crafts, exhibits by local non-profits and meditation experience. At the majestic Bandshell of Golden Gate Park, this event will demonstrate how to nurture peace and happiness even while living in a fast-paced urban environment. You'll be among some of the best artists, scientists, peace makers and policy makers in the Bay Area at this event. The festival is offered free of charge by a coalition including <a href="http://www.bksanfrancisco.org/">Brahma Kumaris</a>, <a href="http://yogatreesf.org">YogaTree of SF</a>, <a href="http://ccare.stanford.edu/">Stanford University CCARE</a>, <a href="http://noetic.org">Institute of Noetic Sciences</a>, <a href="http://www.uri.org/">United Religions Initiative</a>,  and <a href="http://www.servicespace.org/">ServiceSpace</a>.

V<p>They say if you ride motorcycles you have a family forever. I know that many of us have had our lives enhanced by joining the moto meetup groups and consider many as family. So this picnic is family ~ friends ~ food ~ and fun.</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/1/b/e/600_363325022.jpeg" /></p> <p>Let's have an old-fashioned barbeque picnic with good eats, drinks and games. </p> <p>Many of you have games so bring them with you, think Tug A War, Balloon Toss, Sack Race, Frisbee, Croquet, Softball, Volleyball, Football, etc. adults and kids can all play. Bring along what you have and like to play at the park. We can have some friendly competition.  I'll be bringing a golf ball toss game. </p> <p>This is for the motorcycle friends to all get together and share good old-fashioned camaraderie so bring your partners, kids and grandkids.</p> <p>Cost will be $7 per adult (15+) and $3 per child (under 5 free). This will cover many items: ice, paper products, utensils, mustard, catsup, bbq sauce, relish, mayo, salt &amp; pepper, garlic, some hot dogs, buns, charcoal, fluid. </p> <p>**What to bring: Each family should bring something to barbeque and beverages enough for you and their guests and a side dish to share (feeds 10-15). Chairs, blankets, sunscreen, games, what ever will make you have a comfy enjoyable day.</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/8/0/c/600_363330732.jpeg" /></p> <p>Who would like to man/woman the grill?</p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a </p>

V<p>Enjoy the spectacular clifftop views of the sea on this 1-mile hike. Some of it is paved; some is dirt. Mostly flat with a short, steep dirt section (about 20 feet in elevation). Bring a walking stick for that part if you're unsteady. We may go farther if everyone wants to.</p> <p>Dogs are welcome.</p> <p>Bathrooms and free parking are at the meeting spot. I'll hold an 8.5 x 11 meetup sign at the entrance to the Lands End Lookout Visitor Center.</p>

V<p>Meet other local fans of the financial board game of CashFlow 101/202 by Kiyosaki. We'll be exploring some interesting concepts to enhance the practical application of the game. You won't look at the world of finance &amp; investing the same way again! If you have a copy of the game please bring it along. We usually get more then one going at a time. Danville CashFlow Game Meetup - EastBayPlus Cash Flow club is an official RichDad Cash Flow club. Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate children at this location. If we find a different venue that is more "kid-friendly" then that, of course, can change. Let's have some FUN!</p>

V<p>During our last book club meetup we had great conversation over drinks during the Happy Hour at Zephyr Restaurant in downtown Livermore. For our next book club meet up we will be reading Snow Child by Eowyn Ivey. This is a fictional story set in Alaska in the 1920's. I invite all old and new book lovers to this meetup. Even if you don't get a chance to read the book, we are great about not spoiling the end for the new comers or our busy book lovers who haven't quite reached the end of the story by the time we meet to discuss it.</p> <p>Lets meet at a residence again since we are not heading to a movie following this meet up. Anyone interested in hosting please let me know.</p>

V<p>I've decided to extend this tasting to this grp as a courtesy since you guys have been showing up a lot lately.  Typically this event is only open to my Vino grp. </p> <p>So w/ this in mind - don't wait to sign up, as there is a limit to how many we can fit in the house and on the deck, and my guys usually fill the place.</p> <p><br/><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/7/a/event_341139802.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>                                                     ~~~IT"S WINE TIME!!!~~~</b></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>The featured varietal for August is Merlot.<br/></b></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p>This will be a blind tasting of the stated varietal - No you don't have to be blind to participate - just wear cool sunglasses.</p> <p>It works like this:  We get together for hors d'oeuvres, vino, and fun before the tasting starts.</p> <p><b>The</b>n we'll start the actual tasting, and then have more food, vino, and fun!</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/0/e/event_341140462.jpeg" /></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p>There will be a social hour beginning at 6:45pm, then we'll start the tasting sometime thereafter.</p> <p>Ea member brings a bottle of Merlot in the $15-$25 price range.</p> <p>The bottles will be bagged and numbered and we'll have note sheets w/ categories for rating the wine.  At the end of the night (or sometime) we'll determine which bottle wins ( this will be determined numerically) - pls no questions yet!</p> <p><b><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/d/0/a/event_341140202.jpeg" /></b></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000aIf this isn't clear I'm sure it's just because I'm a kindergarten dropout, and has nothing to do w/ the fact that you're just not grasping what I'm saying.</p> <p>Just kidding.  Well not about my education, or lack thereof.  Ah, but I digress.  Don't worry about the details, as they will sort themselves, after you've done this once you'll love it.</p> <p>For August we'll be tasting Merlot - remember the required price range is $15-$25</p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/9/a/event_341140602.jpeg" /></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>What To Bring:</b></p> <p>~<b>A bottle of Merlot in the $15-$25 price range</b> (this insures a relatively consistent tasting).</p> <p>~<b>Hors d'oeuvres</b> - be creative (brie and sourdough is always popular - especially when the brie is hot - we can heat it for you), meats, hard cheeses w/ bread and/or crackers, soft cheeses, etc.  At the last tasting we had a great assortment of food, snacks, and hot food (yes, you can use the oven).   Thx guys!</p> <p>~ If you can, <b>PLEASE BRING EXTRA VINO</b> for drinking before the tasting begins (red, white, purple, whatever).   Purple???</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/b/6/a/event_341143882.jpeg" /></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a<b>Beyond that bring whatever you think we'll enjoy.  There's no pressure to spend a ton of $$$ on this event, other than for the required wine and hors d'oeuvres - so just come enjoy yourself and have fun.</b></p> <p>As always, PLEASE update your RSVP early if you think you won't make it, out of consideration to the host and grp - thx!  Since this is held at a members home it's important to let us know if your plans change.</p> <p><b>My top priority is for everyone to have fun and connect, and pls be patient if the tasting doesn't begin at a decent hour - remember we're here to have fun!</b></p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/d/5/a/event_341140282.jpeg" /></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a<b>Optional, but really helpful:</b></p> <p><b>~A main or side dish - again be creative.</b></p> <p><b>~Extra vino you think we might enjoy during the social hour, prior to the tasting.</b></p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/a/f/e/600_350576062.jpeg" /></p> <p>\u000a\u000a\u000a<b>As always, your sense of humour is required!</b></p> <p>In other words, don't take this too seriously - we're here for a good time!</p>

V<p>Hey all!</p> <p>I think we should go to Sprout Cafe on University Ave. It's a really cool salad place. You fill out a form which has a bunch of different ingredients and then the restaurant makes your salad to order. You can't make a reservation, but I intend to show up early and get a table.</p> <p>Here is the website: <a href="http://www.cafesprout.com/home" class="linkified">http://www.cafesprout.com/home</a></p> <p>I would park at the parking garage on high street. There are usually parks towards the top of the garage. Anyway, looking forward to seeing everyone!</p>

V<p>Open to all Santa Cruz and nearby communities. 4th Saturday evening every month starting 8 pm going till about 9;30 - 10 pm. Calling in the directions, shamanic drumming, send distance healing, personal and group cleansing, journeying, power dancing, divination... A good way to get introduced to shamanism, and for those who are familiar with these practices and spiritual approach, a friendly and grounded way to maintain the practices. 3 dollars donation (please!) to give to the Quaker Center which lets us use the space. Located at the Santa Cruz Quaker Center at 225 Rooney Street, Santa Cruz.</p> <p>Bring a blanket or small rug to lay on the floor (otherwise it is hard), pillow if you want, something to rest over your eyes during journeying to shield yourself from any light, your drums and rattles, and personal sacred items if you want to lay them on the alter during the gathering.</p> <p>Gatherings were initially led by Dr. Steve Serr, ex-psychologist-turned-shamanic-mentor. Steve was not only passionate about regathering the ancient ways and wisdom that grew from our ancestral understandings of our natural relationship with a sacred Earth, but has been encouraging this group to continue evolving shamanism and Earth-centered spirituality curriculum to meet the needs of the contemporary era.</p> <p>For a period of time (unknown! Depends on how many become involved!) Steve and his mentors who teach at Shamanism 101 are letting members of the Santa Cruz Shamanic Spirituality Circle take their online shamanic training course, which is pretty much the same as what Steve was teaching in his circles at the Quaker Meeting House in Santa Cruz. Information about this is tacked below.</p> <p><br/>His dream and goal is that this circle becomes self-governing and maintaining, and takes the training through Shamanism 101 so that they can easily facilitate for themselves what Steve was facilitating.</p> <p><br/>What are for now monthly gatherings, provide Santa Cruz and the surrounding communities with the sacred space for personal and group healing and wellness based on safe and time-honored shamanic and Earth-centered spiritual practices and protocols.</p> <p>Ethical, accurate and safe protocols of practice need to be passed forward that rely on the 'core' shamanic elements from throughout the world and over history, and rest on a recognition and relationship with a sacred Earth from which our indigenous wellness and shamanic healing practices come.</p>

For those of you who don't know what the Real Escape Room is about, our group will literally be locked in a room together and will have to solve a series of connected puzzles to find a way to get out of the room. Kind of like Saw but we are only mentally tortured, not physically tortured. For more info, please check out this link <a href="http://realescapegame.com/rersf1/"><a href="http://realescapegame.com/rersf1/" class="linkified">http://realescapegame.com/rersf1/</a></a></p> <p>I bought out the entire 11-person block for the escape session on August 23rd at 10:30am (10:00am is just our meetup time, to make sure we aren't late starting), which means that it will be only our group playing the game. When buying the tickets I specified that it's my/our group's first time playing, so if anyone has done this before, I imagine that the puzzles will be identical to what you have played before. So don't come unless you are good at not spoiling things for other people :)</p> <p><br/>The cost of attending is $29 / person. I won't start hounding people for money until a week before / the week of the event, so don't worry about payment for now. All I ask is that if you RSVP, you actually show up and eventually pay me back sometime (I take reimbursement in alcohol as well as cash), and that if you can't make it, you remove yourself from the RSVP list ASAP if there are people on the waitlist.</p>

V<p> A Great Little hike - Perfect for Sunday Morning !</p> <p>  Discovery Hikers are exploring a little different kind of hike this week. We call these Urban hikes and this is how many of us got started before Meetups Hiking Groups were invented.</p> <p>  The Route : Climbing ASCOT DR (approx. 850 feet of surface street ) and on to a dirt trail at the end of Ascot dr. to the top of Open Space of Mulholland Dr. then back down ( on surface streets ) to Donald Dr. and return to the Rheem Theater , a 4 1/2 mile Moderate rated URBAN HIKE ! </p> <p>  Not considered easy be any means but a nice steady climb of about 800 feet and plenty of flat and mellow sections to catch your breath and check out the valley views of Moraga that make this hike a favorite of ours.</p> <p> NOTE :  The Organizers have this hike Rated :   Moderate -  Approx. 80 % on Surface Streets and the balance on Dirt surfaces, single track trails that connect to form a Loop of 5 miles. Allow 2 - 2  1/2 hours round trip</p> <p>   NOTE :  This hike is among some of the more easier events we do on a regular basis. If you'd like a little more gentle hike on sure footing, and still get your heart rate up then this might just be what you need. Compare this level of difficulty to Lafayette reservoir Lower loop ,maybe 1 1/2 times around .</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/f/e/a/600_384016362.jpeg" /></p>

Let's see how many people will actually show up.</p> <p>It's a day of the new moon, so our chances for seeing wild deer will be greater - if we try to be quiet and stay observant.</p> <p>It will be the middle of the summer, and the fresh greens will be starting to wilt . We will find what we can.</p> <p><br/>At the same time, various nuts and berries will be beginning to form.</p> <p><br/>Let's check it out!</p>

I will bring some jam and sorrel.</p> <p>From Victoria:</p> <p><br/>I am excited to say that I will be hosting our Monthly Garden Share this coming weekend.

I will also bring a few jars of jam that we made during the skill-shares last summer. Come let your fellow gardeners know what you\u2019re doing with your garden during this drought, and what you're planning with your starts next Sunday. </p> <p>Please bring whatever you have extra from your garden to share, and even if you don\u2019t please come and share yourself.</p>

V<p><b>East Bay DFA\u2019s Summer Picnic -</b> <b>Party for Victory 2014!</b> </p> <p><b>CoHosted with Wellstone Democratic Renewal Club</b> </p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p>&lt;strong style="font-size : 15px"&gt;We\u2019re having a picnic to celebrate the victories we've achieved over the past twelve months and the opportunities we still have in 2014.</b></p> <p> </p> <p>&lt;strong style="font-size : 15px"&gt;Meet up with old friends and make new ones as we get ready for the election!</b></p> <p> Sunday August 24, 2014 </p> <p>1737 Alston Way, Berkeley, CA</p> <p><br/>1pm to 6pm</p> <p><b>RSVP Today!</b><br/><a href="http://www.meetup.com/dfa-78"><a href="http://www.meetup.com/dfa-78/events/194575672/" class="linkified">http://www.meetup.com/dfa-78/events/194575672/</a></a></p> <p><br/>Please bring a substantial side dish, salad, or dessert, + what you\u2019d like to drink. Wellstone will supply burgers, dogs, boca burgers, and the fxin\u2019s. </p> <p>\u000a\u000a<b>What victories?</b> </p> <p>\u2022 Equality for all is coming to pass as more states either vote to allow gay marriage or the courts rule that laws banning gay marriage are unconstitutional. Marriage is a right that we should all enjoy. Enough said!</p> <p>\u2022 Obamacare becomes real and even with it's website's abysmal failure in the first months, more people sign up for insurance than anyone expected. The Republicans lose one of their basic messages "It will never be accepted and it will never work". There's still room to make California a test case for single payer. Let's show the country it can work here.</p> <p>\u2022 The minimum wage is going up.  San Jose raised the minimum wage to $10.15/hr. on January 1.  Seattle just voted to raise their wage to $15/hr. Berkeley City Council just voted to raise their wage to $10/hr. It may not be a living wage or even a fair wage, but it's a good start.</p> <p>\u2022 Janet Yellen becomes chair of the Federal Reserve. The first woman to hold that post beat the odds when her supporters wouldn't budge on her nomination to the post. Her goal is to get people back to work while keeping the economy going. She's not likely to be friendly to big Federal handouts to Wall Street interests.</p> <p><br/>\u2022 This year a slate of four progressive candidates for county council, backed up by grassroots activists were elected over a business slate. Their first order of business was to kill a port expansion to ship coal to China. Grassroots activists can and do win against the monied interests.  We have the opportunity to do that here in the East Bay this year.</p> <p><b>What opportunities and lessons learned?</b> </p> <p>\u2022 <i>Turnout is key! Whether it\u2019s walking precincts, making phone calls or donating to campaigns, your personal effort at the grassroots can make the difference.</i> </p> <p>In California we have a chance to pick up 2 of the seats the Democrats need to win back the House and see Speaker Pelosi wield the gavel again. </p> <p>In California we are within striking distance of having a 2/3 majority in both the Senate and the Assembly that works together as a team to set the agenda and pass bills we know need to be passed. </p> <p>\u2022 <i>We can support Progressive candidates across the country. DFA National is in the forefront of identifying Progressive candidates and putting resources into their elections.</i> </p> <p>We are in the process of identifying a Congressional race in another state where we can help win two races at once. We want a Congressional race where we can turn Red to Blue and a Senate race where we are preserving a Blue seat and keep control of the Seanate. </p> <p>\u2022 <i>In Colorado in 2012, we came close to defeating a Tea Party Republican in CD-06. It wasn\u2019t just inspiration that turned the voters out \u2013 rank and file union members and progressives of all sorts engaged in massive get out the vote efforts in every corner of the the district to make this happen. This year there's a strong candidate with better funding and a good track record in the State House. More on this at the party.</i></p> <p><br/><b>Tony Thurmond's overwhelming victory in our May Meetup straw poll helped get him out of the gate in the June Primary. Our endorsement of Abel Guillen was an early boost to his campaign.</b></p> <p><b>Now let\u2019s get both of them across the finish line this Fall!</b> </p> <p>Tony Thurmond \u2013 Assembly District 15 \u2013 East Bay shoreline from Pinole to Piedmont including North Oakland, Montclair, Berkeley, El Cerrito, Albany, Richmond, El Sobrante and Hercules.</p> <p>Abel Guillen \u2013Oakland Council District 2 </p> <p>With long hours of daylight this summer, we need everyone\u2019s help to work on their campaigns so we hit the ground running in September!</p> <p><b>Tony Thurmond</b> \u2013 Tony spent his formative years being raised by his aunt. That's where he learned that education is the only way out of poverty. As a social worker and education director of Lincoln Child Center, Tony has developed innovative ways to reduce violence, keep kids in school and provide job training to give hardworking people a path to the middle class. He also has a long record of fighting for clean air and water, reducing pollution and banning toxic chemicals.  He will continue that work with a call to ban fracking in California. <br/><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>\u2022 Abel Guillen</b> is currently serving his second term as a Trustee for the Peralta Community College District and he\u2019s currently serving as it\u2019s President. As a Trustee, he has established himself as a leader on improving the quality of education, expanding career training programs, and providing strong fiscal stewardship for improving access to healthcare and making the college system greener. As a Councilmember, he will provide this kind of leadership in City Hall on the tough issues facing Oakland and the East Bay.  <b><br/></b><br/>Interested in Progressive Change? Want to have fun? Come to our Summer Picnic!! </p> <p><b>RSVP Today to help our candidates to victory in 2014!</b></p> <p><b><br/></b> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/dfa-78"><a href="http://www.meetup.com/dfa-78/events/194575672/" class="linkified">http://www.meetup.com/dfa-78/events/194575672/</a></a></p> <p><br/><b>We\u2019re always looking for a few good members to join our organizing team at DFA!</b> </p> <p>\u000a\u000aCome talk to any of the team members to consider joining the EB Democracy for America organizing team: <i>Janet, Michael, Norman, Vincent &amp; Yvonne</i>. </p>

V<p>(Day currently tentative) So, I'm having many housewarmings. Normal people housewarming. Cosplay people housewarming. And, now, the Brony housewarming! And, while I'm at it, let's finally get around to that game of Cards Against Equestria with real, professionally printed cards!</p> <p>In addition to CAE, I've got a goodly number of board games, and you feel free to bring more. By this time, we may also be lucky enough to have the 4th season available on Netflix!</p> <p>On food: Semi-potluck. I'll provide something or the other, but, in case this gets big, please, everyone, plan on bringing a bit of something for everyone else. And especially if you have dietary restrictions.</p> <p>On gifts: DON'T. Do not. The only possible slight exception: seeds and seedlings from your own garden. Not ones you bought. Ones you harvested.</p>

V<p>I think that large-format means -at least to me- *prints*, the final expression of your vision. Thus, I hereby suggest that there be a gathering of the LF-folk at my house in San Jose on 24th. You should bring prints, not required but I think the effort is worthwhile for everyone. Make the prints whatever way you can: alt-process contact prints, silver gelatin prints, digital prints of film scans, alt-process prints of digital negatives, even digital prints from LF digital backs [Bill:)] ... I hope some sort of emulsion should be involved, that's all. This will be about sharing your images with your peers in a welcoming, supportive environment. Everyone is welcome.</p>

V<p>On August 24,  2014 at 2:30 P.M. the Masonic Philosophical Society will be hosting a study group at the Santa Cruz Masonic Lodge. In each Meetup a different topic, ranging from philosophy and science to religion and metaphysics, is discussed, debated and related to the principles of Freemasonry.</p> <p><br/>The topic for August is, "Freemasonry and the metaphysical qualities of the spoken word." The spoken language has many associations with creation,  ritual, and Freemasonry. What is it about verbal expression that lends itself to this connection? What are the differences between ritual with definite and consistent language compared to more open, free-form ritual, and how has this affected Freemasonry. </p> <p><br/>This group for men and women, which is open to the public, is where non-members can learn more about Freemasonry, as well as meet local Co-Masons. </p>

V<p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/a/600_343987082.jpeg" /></p> <p>This month we will be reading <i><b>Misfortune: A Novel</b></i> by Wesley Stace.</p> <p>Victorian dandy Lord Geoffroy Loveall is faced with a dilemma. As heir apparent to Love Hall, he must produce an heir of his own; but his obsessive love for his long-dead sister has rendered him a paralytic in matters of the heart. Adding to Geoffroy's troubles is his difficult mother, Lady Loveall, who mercilessly castigates her effeminate son, and a circling mob of greedy relatives anxious to wrest Love Hall from his grasp.</p> <p>Then, a miracle occurs. As his carriage passes a trash dump, Geoffroy spies an abandoned baby in the jaws of a cur. He saves the child, names her Rose, and declares her his rightful heir. The shock fells Lady Loveall on the spot, and Rose becomes the pampered daughter of Lord Loveall and his bride of convenience, the resident librarian Anonyma. This joyful period lasts until Rose's adolescence, when it becomes increasingly difficult to hide the one great secret of Love Hall: namely, that Rose, now in the position of fending off suitors for her titled hand, is in fact a boy. </p> <p>Rose's whiskers, deepening voice, and affection for the daughter of a courtier have not gone unnoticed. Armed with the new revelation, the Loveall's unscrupulous relatives launch a coup, and a desperately confused Rose is cast adrift -- until he finds the renewed vitality that comes from the love of true family and realizes that he can and must go home.</p> <p><br/>Please join us for some good discussion and social time. Refreshments will be available. (Please feel free to bring a snack or beverage. I will supply at least one bottle of wine.) <i>There is never any pressure to have the book completed (or read at all) in order to attend.</i> We would just love to have you, and it can be enjoyable to hear about the book and meet some cool people. </p> <p><i>Remember that Books, Inc. provides book club members a 15% discount on the books we are reading for the meetup.</i> Call ahead to make sure they have a copy available for you. They can also arrange to have books shipped to you. </p> <p>Parking and transportation: </p> <p>Parking can be challenging, but there are a number of options. There are the obvious street meters which are free at this time. In addition to these there are two outdoor lots and a parking garage in the vicinity, all of which are also free on Sundays. (Regularly $0.50/hr) The Civic Center Parking Structure is next door to the Alameda Theatre and is located at 1416 Oak Street, between Central Avenue and Santa Clara Avenue. Lot A is accessible from Park Avenue between Central avenue and Santa Clara Avenue. Lot B is accessible from both Central Avenue and Alameda Avenue between Oak Street and Park Street. The bookstore is also not too far from the Fruitvale BART Station on Oakland. It is an easy bus ride from there. Arrangements can also be made with the organizer and/or other members for rides to and from the BART. Just post requests and availability to the comments, or e-mail me through the web page links.</p>

V<p>This is sure to be a very fun evening together but also one where intention and major shifts will be set in motion!</p> <p>A vision board is a simple yet powerful visualization tool that activates the universal law of attraction to begin manifesting your dreams into reality.</p> <p>It is simply a visual representation or collage of the things that you want to have, be and do in your life. It consists of a poster board with cut-out pictures, drawings and writing on it of the things that you want in your life or the things that you want to become.</p> <p>Supplies I Will Provide:</p> <p>Colored Markers/Poster board/Scissors/Glue/Magazines</p> <p>I have made plenty in my lifetime and without fail all my goals have come to fruition!</p> <p>The purpose of a vision board is to activate the law of attraction to begin to pull things from your external environment that will enable you to realize your dream. By selecting pictures and writing that charges your emotions with feelings of passion, you will begin to manifest those things into your life.The law of attraction states that we attract into our lives anything that we give attention to regardless whether it be positive or negative.</p> <p>Your personal vision board is only limited by the extent of your own creativity. Having artistic ability is not a prerequisite for creating a functional vision board.</p> <p>Visual. Your subconscious mind works in pictures and images, so make your vision board as visual as possible with as many pictures as you can. You can supplement your pictures with words and phrases to increase the emotional response you get from it.</p> <p>Emotional. Each picture on your vision board should evoke a positive emotional response from you. The mere sight of your vision board should make you happy and fuel your passion to achieve it every time you look at it.</p> <p>Strategically-placed. Your vision board should be strategically placed in a location that gives you maximum exposure to it. You need to constantly bath your subconscious mind with it\u2019s energy in order to manifest your desires quicker than you hope.</p> <p>Personal. Negative feelings, self-doubt, and criticism can damage the delicate energy that your vision board emits. If you fear criticism or justification of your vision board from others, then place it in a private location so it can only be seen by yourself.</p> <p>Supplies I Will Provide:</p> <p>Colored Markers/Poster board/Scissors/Glue/Magazines</p> <p>If you can, compile your pictures at home to bring into class though we will have time to do in class, as well. Start by going through your magazines and compiling all the pictures that you can find that are relevant to your goal. Don\u2019t evaluate the pictures just stack them into a pile. Make sure that each image that you will put on your board resonates with your heart and makes you excited at the mere look of it.</p> <p>It\u2019s also important when selecting pictures to include anything that is congruent with your goal, such as any changes in your life that might result from obtaining your goal. So if your goal is to have a six figure income, then select pictures of a lifestyle that is congruent with your six figure income. Asking yourself the following questions might help:</p> <p>What would you do differently when you realize your goal?<br/>Where would you travel?<br/>Where would you live?<br/>What would you wear?<br/>What things would you own?<br/>What kind of vehicle would you drive?<br/>What would you do for work? Or would you work?<br/>Who would you help?</p> <p>When the day comes to actually place your pictures onto your board don\u2019t worry about being artistic\u2014that\u2019s not the point. The point is that your board should resonate with your emotions. You should arrange your pictures in a way that gives you an emotional connection to your vision board.</p>

V<p>Come join us for an evening of silent meditation in sacred community. Silent meditation gives one the space to unfold and relax into one's natural and undivided self. This practice is excellent for maintaining a life of well being while consciously continuing along a path of self care and discovery.  In practicing together, we support each other in our individual processes as well as being with what is, exactly as it is in the present moment.</p> <p>This event is led in Satsang style, including a talk about an aspect of the path of meditation and an interactive exploration that gives the participants the opportunity to consciously open into their deepest selves.  This group is offered every Monday evening at the East Bay Healing Collective, and draws upon teachings from many traditions including Advaita Vedanta, Western Non-dualism, and indigenous traditions of North and South America. In the event of a Guest Teacher facilitating, the evening may be lead in a Dharma Talk style. This is similar to Satsang, but different in that it is of the Buddhist tradition.</p> <p>Open to everyone and well-suited for beginners and experienced meditators alike, a typical evening includes 40 minutes of meditation, a talk inspired by various spiritual teachings, and interactive time of Q &amp; A / discussion.  One only needs the openness to sit with oneself, the curiosity to be with what arises, and the courage to be honest about what is discovered.</p> <p>If you are new to meditation and would like some extra guidance or have questions, feel free to come a few minutes early and/or stay a few minutes late!  Further your practice with us, or come dip a toe into a quiet reflective space and explore what is here for you.</p> <p><b>Administrative Event Host and Teacher:</b> Rain Elizabeth Stickney, teaches the 4th Monday of the month April - July 2014.</p> <p><b>Guest Teachers:</b> Adam Baraz, Katherine Roubos, George Peterson, Micha'el Bedar, Mike McGarry, Nicki Koethner.</p> <p>Teaching Schedule July - August 2014</p> <p>July 7th - Micha'el Bedar</p> <p>July 14th - Mike McGarry</p> <p>July 21st - Mike McGarry</p> <p>July 28th - Rain Stickney</p> <p>August 4th - Micha'el Bedar</p> <p>August 11th - Mike McGarry</p> <p>August 18th - Adam Baraz</p> <p>August 25th - Multiple Teachers Present in Celebration of the Evolution of the Group!</p>

V<p>New to Magic: The Gathering? Want to play Magic at a game store but with familiar faces? I will be taking up a table at Illusive for us to learn and play the game. Illusive is an ideal place to learn, as they have free starter decks available and staff willing to help remind me of Magic rules I may have forgotten.</p> <p>(Apologies for the new event title. I couldn't resist! :D)</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xybbnMbAews" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xybbnMbAews</a></p> <p>If you want to show up earlier, you can! Illusive has an open gaming day on Mondays from 11am to 7pm. (I will try to make it there by 6:30pm, myself.) I've also been told there are demo board games available, if you want a break from Magic, or are waiting to play a match. Or you can even browse the store's excellent selection of comics!</p> <p>Because this is a small venue, I am limiting the event to 8 people in the hopes we will average around 4-6 attendees. For small events like these, you may also email me directly or comment here if you want to know whether you can still come at the last minute.</p>

V<p>The Logic and Prop chapters of Software Foundations clarify some of the Coq basics we've been skirting around till now. I don't claim that using Coq won't feel like playing Adventure after we've done these chapters, but we might at least feel like more experienced players.</p> <p>Note that I'm basing the chapter numbers on the July 2014 issue of Software Foundations, which inserts another chapter (Rel, on properties of relations) in between Logic and Prop. Having skimmed all three chapters, though, I think it makes more sense to postpone Rel.</p> <p>And don't forget that gate code! *1111 will get you into Mixrank.</p>

V<p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/f/4/6/600_384653062.jpeg" /></p> <p>Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world.</p> <p>Societies that had had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed religion\u2014as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war\u2014and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures.</p> <p>A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science, the Rhone-Poulenc Prize, and the Commonwealth club of California's Gold Medal. (From the publisher.)</p>

It's an interactive event where you'll meet people you might not otherwise meet, and do more than just sit and fiddle with your Smartphone, or just listen to speakers talk about their work. The Townhalls are for sharing useful information, and meeting useful people to grow your team and your company to the next level.</p> <p>6:30-7:00 Loose Networking, Mingling, and Snacks<br/>7:00-7:15 Producer Foundry Organizers announcements and housekeeping.<br/>7:15-7:30 Community/Crowdfunding Announcements (email Ben for Details)<br/>7:30-7:45 Featured Speaker: TBA<br/>7:45-8:00 Popcorn Presentation Round<br/>8:00-8:15 Raffle<br/>8:30-9:00 Networking follow-up</p> <p>We're asking for a 5 dollar suggested donation at the door, but no one will be turned away for lack of funds. We'd rather have you there without the donation, than not have you there at all. The money is primarily to cover location costs, and the cost of the snacks.</p>

V<p>Hope you can join us in August! Carissa</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/e/0/c/600_382147692.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh-</b>In this classic tale of British life between the World Wars, Waugh parts company with the satire of his earlier works to examine affairs of the heart. Charles Ryder finds himself stationed at Brideshead, the family seat of Lord and Lady Marchmain. Exhausted by the war, he takes refuge in recalling his time spent with the heirs to the estate before the war--years spent enthralled by the beautiful but dissolute Sebastian and later in a more conventional relationship with Sebastian's sister Julia. Ryder portrays a family divided by an uncertain investment in Roman Catholicism and by their confusion over where the elite fit in the modern world.</p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/d/7/6/600_382147542.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>Evelyn Waugh (1903-1966)</b> was born into a publishing family in Hampstead, England, and educated at Oxford. After a brief stint as a schoolmaster, he turned to writing. His biography of Dante Gabriel Rossetti appeared in 1928, but it was his sensational first novel, <i>Decline and Fall</i>, published the same year, that set the course for his career. Waugh wrote sixteen novels, including <i>The Loved One</i>, <i>Scoop</i>, and <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>.                        </p> <p>Evelyn Waugh's best-loved novel and the basis for the PBS television production, Brideshead Revisited, the epic story of a great Catholic family in a doomed aristocratic age.</p>

V<p>Going beyond the basics of how to use Spock, this talk will discuss writing expressive, readable &amp; maintainable specifications using the features of Spock and the Groovy language itself. We'll do a whistle-stop tour around how to structure assertions, effective use of the where: block, appropriate use of mocks and stubs, driving specifications from a database along with other patterns, anti-patterns and techniques. Knowledge of the basics of Spock is assumed.</p>

The sheer abundance of large animals underwater found at one place was unfathomable for me before I visited Cocos.</p> <p>I will share the beauty of Cocos through photography, what we are learning about the importance of CocosIsland for sea turtles and sharks, and what needs to be done to protect these species at Cocos and during their migrations to and from Cocos.  I will also describe our Cocos Island Citizen Scientist program that is involving divers in collecting data and assisting us on our research expeditions.</p> <p><b>Biography:                 </b></p> <p><a href="http://acssfbay.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/todd-photo.jpg?w=625" class="linkified">http://acssfbay.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/todd-photo.jpg?w=625</a></p> <p>Todd Steiner, M.S., Executive Director, Turtle Island Restoration Network <br/>Todd Steiner is the founder and executive director of Turtle Island Restoration Network (TIRN), overseeing its four primary initiatives \u2013 SeaTurtles.org, SpawnUSA.org, and GotMercury.org.

Maybe you saw someone you thought was cute. Maybe you had an inappropriate thought cross your mind.</p> <p>Maybe you saw something that inspired or even pissed you off. Many things/people/conversations leave us with this ignited feeling in our body. (yes, deep down we all like the feeling of TurnON!) You know it's TurnON because it ignites -- as though your body is giving you a cue, shouting out "I'm ALIVE in here"!</p> <p>TurnON leaves you feeling more alert, ignited and happy.</p> <p>At OneTaste, we believe TurnON is the ignition that leads to a more of what we really want in life. We believe it is the first step to knowing what is possible.</p> <p>So, we started an evening event designed specifically to give people the opportunity to feel TurnON in themselves. (p.s., it's totally PG-13) It's an evening where, through only talking, we begin to experience these exhilarating, normal, often ignored feelings -- referred to as TurnON. A room of people (cool, fun people) engage in honest, humorous, playful conversation around topics we mostly only consider having in our head.</p> <p>TurnOn leads to authenticity and authenticity leads to the kind of connection we hope for around the globe.</p> <p>The evening leaves you invigorated, happy and inspired. We are meant to live TurnedON.</p> <p><i><br/></i></p> <p><i>Details:</i><br/>Singles &amp; Couples Welcome<br/>This event is $10</p> <p> </p>

We welcome anyone to attend a GoRampUp! meeting, once, for free as our guest, so you can learn what the innovative GoRampUp! business-networking experience is all about. Note, we are not able to give you a free meeting at more than one of our many locations.</p> <p>YOU MUST obtain a free-access GoRampUp! Golden ticket by registering for a specific meeting at<a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar/"><a href="http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/" class="linkified">http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/</a></a>. This ticket must be presented at your complimentary meeting for you to gain admittance. Without this ticket you will, unfortunately, be declined access to our innovative and exclusive business-networking meeting. WITH a GoRampUp! Golden Ticket, you will be welcomed with open arms!</p> <p>It can be too difficult to attract new clients. We help you fix that! We're a business-impact community. We're informal and fun, yet, by design, we're extremely effective!</p> <p>We help people who work for a living to get a much greater payoff from working. We do this in three specific ways under our three CoreSuccess Platforms: 1) We help you move toward mastery with business-networking, 2) We help you move toward mastery with business performance, and, 3) We help you move toward mastery with personal development.</p> <p>How do we deliver on this promise to our community members? Each month we conduct dozens of business-networking meetings in more than a dozen cities in the SF Bay Area. A member may attend all of our "OpenConnect" business-networking meetings. And our members are welcome and encouraged to attend any and all of these meetings and locations.</p> <p>Each month we introduce and emphasize a learning and development subject under each of our three CoreSuccess Platforms.

Proia and Drew Simshaw at Indiana University.</p> <p>Topic Description: </p> <p>In the same way that individuals and organizations utilize the cloud as a convenient and cost effective way to store and manage data, soon too will robots.  \u201cCloud robotics\u201d has been described as \u201ca new approach to robotics that takes advantage of the Internet as a resource for massively parallel computation and sharing of vast data resources.\u201d  In short, the cloud will make robots lighter, cheaper, more efficient, and able to learn from each other.  But cloud robotics appears poised to join a host of modern technologies whose development has rapidly outpaced the legal and regulatory regimes implemented to protect the security and privacy of data.  This presentation will identify the unique data security and privacy challenges posed by cloud robotics, and consider how the law can begin to address them, so that when this technology enters our homes, hospitals, and organizations, the robots\u2019 heads will be in the clouds, but ours will not.</p> <p>Our Speakers:</p> <p>Andrew Proia recently completed a postdoctoral fellowship in information security law and policy at the Indiana University Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research and Maurer School of Law. His work has focused on information privacy, cybersecurity, and cybercrime. He is a regular contributor to Cybercrime Review and his work has appeared in the <i>Indiana Law Journal</i> and the <i>University of Florida Journal of Law and Public Policy</i>. Andrew received his JD from the Indiana University, Maurer School of Law, where he served as a managing editor of the <i>Indiana Law Journal</i> and was a research assistant to Professor Fred H. Cate. He received a BS in Criminal Justice from the University of Central Florida.</p> <p>Drew Simshaw is an information security policy analyst at the Center for Law, Ethics, and Applied Research in Health Information (CLEAR) at Indiana University. His work focuses on security and privacy issues associated with cloud computing, big data, and new technologies. He previously served as Postdoctoral Fellow in Information Security Law and Policy at the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research, an NSA and DHS National Center of Academic Excellence in both Information Assurance Education and Information Assurance Research. A proud AmeriCorps alum, Drew earned his B.A. from the University of Washington and his J.D. from the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, where he was an articles editor for the Federal Communications Law Journal. He is a member of the Indiana Bar and the International Association of Privacy Professionals.</p> <p>A dial-in will be provided by the day before the conference for those who can't be there in person.  Please indicate on an RSVP if you plan to attend in person.</p> <p>Please note the new location in downtown San Jose at the Silicon Valley Law Group.</p>

V<p>Startup Finance: Valuation</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/b/2/event_100045522.jpeg" /></p> <p><b>About:</b> Learn how to value a startup.</p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core. Valuation makes or breaks a company. It is critical to understand valuation as an investor, entrepreneur, consultant and employee.</p> <p>There are many circumstances in which valuation is critical:</p> <p><b>A.</b> You are looking to raise funding for your company.</p> <p><b>B.</b> You are looking to invest in a startup.</p> <p><b>C.</b> You are looking to work for a startup and your success is tied to the startup\u2019s success.</p> <p><b>D.</b> You are about to get paid in equity.</p> <p><b>E.</b> You are interested in selling your business.</p> <p>This class is focused on startup valuation with entrepreneurial and non-public valuation needs in mind. We cover concepts such as pre-money, post money valuation and valuation equations used for private companies. We will be looking at Startup Valuation from the financial perspective. You can expect to walk away with a few equations and ideas on how to make financial projections.</p> <p>This class is ideal for entrepreneurs, investors and anyone interested in working for or with a private company. Attendees to this seminar will walk away with a better understanding of the valuation process.  Attendees can expect to walk through a financial example of valuation.</p> <p><b>Testimonials:</b></p> <p><i>\u201cThis is one of the best finance classes I have ever taken.\u201d</i></p> <p><i>- Andrew</i></p> <p><i>\u201cI took the \u201cStartup Finance Valuation\u201d class; excellent job. This class is a must for all entrepreneurs.

Lucky for us, Cooper will be joining us for a one-on-one interview to share insights on: </p> <p>\u2022 The history of personas</p> <p>\u2022 Why Cooper Design considers personas to be the single most powerful design tool</p> <p>\u2022 Considerations when designing and defining personas</p> <p>\u2022 User-centered design concepts</p> <p>\u2022 And more \u2013 much more!</p> <p><br/><b><br/></b></p> <p><b><a href="https://twitter.com/mralancooper">About Alan Cooper</a></b></p> <p><img src="http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/5/f/8/600_381737912.jpeg" /></p> <p>Alan Cooper has been a pioneer in the software world for more than 40 years and, in his role today as éminence grise in the user experience field, he continues to influence a new generation of web designers and entrepreneurs.</p> <p>In 1992, Alan and his wife, Sue, co-founded the first interaction design consulting firm, Cooper. Within a few years Cooper had established the basic design methods that are used across the industry today and helped to popularize the notion that digital technology shouldn\u2019t terrorize its human users. In particular, his invention, design personas, are almost universally used in the field. He shared his tools, knowledge, and experience in two best-selling books, still in print and widely referenced.</p> <p>In 1988 Alan invented a dynamically extensible visual programming tool and sold it to Bill Gates, who released it to the world as Visual Basic, arguably the most successful programming language ever. This is how Alan earned the sobriquet, \u201cThe Father of Visual Basic.\u201d He started his first software company in 1976 and produced what has been called \u201cThe first serious business software for microcomputers.\u201d</p> <p>Today, Alan continues to advocate for more humane technology from his 50-acre former dairy farm in the rolling hills north of San Francisco. </p>

Design will be more important than ever before, because our products will start to be closer, more intimate, and increasingly acting as extensions of our personal identities.</p> <p>As the technologies we use shrink, we see more and more benefits to carrying them close to our bodies and using them more seamlessly in our daily interactions.</p> <p>Participants will come away with a better understanding of design issues that are relevant for wearable products. We will discuss some of the history of wearable computing, some examples from Jeff\u2019s doctoral research, and a rough overview of current wearable products. Jeff will also cover prototyping and research methods that are well adapted for wearable design. We will explore several futuristic product design scenarios and look at how designing for a phone app versus a wearable are different. We will also look at the trajectory of a design for certain types of capabilities and extrapolate on where the field might be going.</p> <p><b>About the Instructor:</b></p> <p>Jeff Axup, Ph.D. is an entrepreneur and UX designer. He researched mobile computing design for backpackers in Australia, has 15 published papers, and over 13 years of design experience. The subject of his Ph.D. was how to conduct research and determine product requirements for mobile communities. He has also studied the effects of mobile technology and design on social behavior.<br/>He previously worked for a usability consulting agency, started two mobile startups, and did a stint as a UX Director leading a team of 10 designers. Jeff is currently the Founder &amp; CEO of Sense6, producing <a href="http://www.artemisfashion.com/">Artemis</a>: fashionable smart-jewelry for personal safety. His work and ideas have been covered in VentureBeat, Wearable Weak, ABC Science News, Vodafone Receiver, and the UPA.</p>

V<p>4v4 pickup (4 simultaneous games if there are enough folks). First session begins at 7pm. Each session is one hour long. Teams are capped at 5 per side to ensure playing time for folks. Substitutions are enforced by the facilitator every 2 minutes so playing time is even spread evenly and everyone can just focus on having fun playing rather than worry about who's going to come out to make room for them. :)</p> <p>The vibe is laid back and fun. Like all SoccerFours sessions, teams are made up at the field, and scores aren't kept. There are no leagues. It's just organized pickup soccer run by a facilitator. $7/person for the session. RSVP here and bring cash to the field or sign up on our main site if you'd like. (If the slots here are full, try our main site to see if there are any left.)</p> <p>Let's have some fun! :)</p>

V<p><b>The New York Times Book Review</b></p> <p>Composed with the skills of a master, The Goldfinch is a haunted odyssey through present day America and a drama of enthralling force and acuity.</p> <p><br/>It begins with a boy. Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art.</p> <p><br/>As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.</p> <p><br/>The Goldfinch is a novel of shocking narrative energy and power. It combines unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and breathtaking suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is a beautiful, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.</p>

We welcome anyone to attend a GoRampUp! meeting, once, for free as our guest, so you can learn what the innovative GoRampUp! business-networking experience is all about. Note, we are not able to give you a free meeting at more than one of our many locations.</p> <p>YOU MUST obtain a free-access GoRampUp! Golden ticket by registering for a specific meeting at<a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar/"><a href="http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/" class="linkified">http://GoRampUp.com/calendar/</a></a>. This ticket must be presented at your complimentary meeting for you to gain admittance. Without this ticket you will, unfortunately, be declined access to our innovative and exclusive business-networking meeting. WITH a GoRampUp! Golden Ticket, you will be welcomed with open arms!</p> <p>It can be too difficult to attract new clients. We help you fix that! We're a business-impact community. We're informal and fun, yet, by design, we're extremely effective!</p> <p>We help people who work for a living to get a much greater payoff from working. We do this in three specific ways under our three CoreSuccess Platforms: 1) We help you move toward mastery with business-networking, 2) We help you move toward mastery with business performance, and, 3) We help you move toward mastery with personal development.</p> <p>How do we deliver on this promise to our community members? Each month we conduct dozens of business-networking meetings in more than a dozen cities in the SF Bay Area. A member may attend all of our "OpenConnect" business-networking meetings. And our members are welcome and encouraged to attend any and all of these meetings and locations.</p> <p>Each month we introduce and emphasize a learning and development subject under each of our three CoreSuccess Platforms. For each of the three learning and development subjects that we introduce and emphasize each month, we give you four different ways to learn it: We produce written learning guides, video learning guides, audio learning guide, and we cover the subjects as 15-to-20-minute mini-workshops inside of our 60-minute business-networking meetings. There's no registration or initiation fee to join. Membership in GoRampUp! is month to month. You enroll when you like, even mid-month, and you depart when you like.</p> <p>Be sure to see our website to learn about <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/growrampup">our generous enrollment incentives</a></p> <p>Also, be sure to learn about our <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/norisk">100-Satisfaction Money-Back Guarantee</a></p> <p>Would you care to come to this meeting, at no cost, to see if there\u2019s business-value for you?</p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">Free-Meeting Guest-RSVP and Golden Ticket Request</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/calendar">View complete meeting details</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href="http://gorampup.com/invite">Invite a Buddy to join you</a></p> <p>One last thing: You REALLY should check out actual testimonial videos by our members: <a href="http://www.gorampup.com/why">See them here</a></p> <p>This page was created to produce awareness of our event.

Other companies already have a sizable investment in Scrum (training, Certifications, coaching, tools, etc.) How can they measure the value they are receiving? In this presentation I discuss the economics of using Scrum: How US and international companies can use Scrum to lower their taxable liability by correctly identifying CapEx and OpEx. How a company can use financial and Scrum based metrics to be more predictive and better prepared to measure ROI with Scrum. Scrum is better equipped and better documented than Waterfall at producing measurable value and cost savings. I also will discuss lessons learned from companies that have used Scrum and metrics to measure financial return.</p> <p>\u2022 Understand the differences between Capital Expenditures and Operational Expense and the US and International laws which govern them.<br/>\u2022 How software developed with Scrum can be used as an financial asset<br/>\u2022 The Economics behind Scrum and why it makes sense in financial world<br/>\u2022 Why Scrum is better than suited than Waterfall to deliver value and lower costs<br/>\u2022 The effect on a company\u2019s bottom line (P&amp;L)<br/>\u2022 Metrics which will show Scrum\u2019s ROI and how to Predict future value<br/>\u2022 Lesson learned from companies that have implemented Scrum and financial measures to predict value</p> <p>Reserve your Webinar seat now at:<br/><a href="https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/669630566" class="linkified">https://www3.gotomeeting.com/register/669630566</a></p>

V<p>What/Why: </p> <p>In 2013, the Sierra Club Loma Prieta Chapter formed a Fracking Action Committee. Until fracking is proven safe in our communities and ecosystems, our goals are to: </p> <p>\u2022 Support Sierra Club California's efforts to pass a state-wide moratorium on fracking through Senate Bill 1132 (Mitchell &amp; Leno) which is in-line with Sierra Club policy</p> <p>\u2022 Work with Santa Clara County Supervisors to discuss adopting an ordinance and/or a moratorium until one is adopted</p> <p>\u2022  Support our partner, San Benito Rising, on their fracking campaign </p> <p>\u2022 Educate and empower people in our Chapter with knowledge on what's happening in their communities and in California, what rights they have, and to avoid having to protest unsafe fracking </p> <p>When/Where:</p> <p>Our team meets every fourth Thursday of the month from 6:00PM-8:00PM in the Peninsula Conservation Center located at 3921 Ea. Bayshore Road, Palo Alto, CA 94303. Join Us in the Library!</p> <p>Contact Mike Kerhin or Kenneth Rosales for more questions: </p> <p>[masked]</p> <p>[masked]</p>

V<p>Dear Bright Community, </p> <p>How would you like to master your story telling and make a great income by taking it to the stage? </p> <p>As the founder of The Bright Side of Life Community and someone who has promoted and listened to hundreds of speakers over the past 10 years, I know one thing for sure; every heart-centered transformational speaker, presenter and leader has a powerful story to tell. The fact is, many don't have the skill-set or the know-how to effectively deliver it with so much impact that it transforms the audience in such a way they thought the speaker was addressing them individually.</p> <p>That's why I am bringing Kelly Swanson, award-winning storyteller, comedian, motivational speaker, and author of \u201cWho Hijacked My Fairy Tale?\u201d to The Bright Side of Life Community on Aug. 28th. Kelly is not only the best story teller, but also someone who's story moves the audience in a way I've never experienced before. </p> <p><i>In addition, I will be sharing with you how telling my own story helped me build a community of over 6000 members, and creating an annual six figure income.</i>&lt;i style="font-size : 16px"&gt; </i></p> <p><img src="http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/f/8/4/600_387924452.jpeg" /></p> <p>Join us on Aug 28th, 6:00 p.m \u2013 9:30 p.m. and d<i>iscover \u201cThe Art of Telling a Good Story\u201d</i> featuring Funny Motivational &amp; Inspirational Speaker, Award-Winning S<a href="http://kellyswanson.net/storyteller">toryteller</a> and C<a href="http://kellyswanson.net/comedian">omedian</a> Kelly Swanson hosted by Community Builder Expert and Founder of the Bright Side of Life Community Sahar Kordahi. </p> <p><br/>Kelly Swanson, built a career on the art of telling a good story. She is the top expert in story telling and will share her number one secret to staying booked, even in a tough economy. Here\u2019s a hint\u2026<i>it\u2019s not about the content.</i> Learn how she went from making no money to booking over 80 shows and speaking engagements a year\u2026and how she went from polite clapping to standing ovations. </p> <p>Here is what else Kelly will be giving us behind the scenes secrets on Aug 28th: </p> <p>* How to transform a great idea for a story into a great presentation on stage </p> <p>* How to master writing a good story that will have your audiences jumping to their feet</p> <p>* How to acquire the skills and tools to create hundreds of stories on your own</p> <p>Sahar Kordahi started the Bright Side of Life in 2008 as a small gathering in her family room with six members. Within less than a year and a half, The Bright Side of Life grew to have over 250 members who attend the monthly live events. Now six years later, The Bright Side of Life has welcomed over 6,000 people to the Bright Side of Life Community.  </p> <p>Sahar believes that storytelling is a critical contributing factor to the growth of The Bright Side of Life. Whether inspirational and motivational stories shared by Sahar to her members, stories told by the expert speakers Sahar has invited to speaker to her community, or The Bright Side of Life community members themselves sharing their own stories\u2026her community keeps coming back for more.</p> <p>When you join us, Sahar will share her unique blend of business savvy seasoned with sage wisdom\u2026</p> <p>* Sahar's Most Cost-Effective Room-Filling Strategy That Generates Souled-Out Bright Side of Life Events (time and time again)</p> <p>* Why Creating Your Own Monthly Live Event is Much Easier to Attract Clients (and More Profitable) </p> <p>* The Most Authentic Way to Create a Sense of Community at Your Live Events so Your Audience Want to Come Back for More <b><i>                                             </i></b> </p> <p><br/> For Our VIP Sponsors: </p> <p><br/>* Please arrive at 5:00 pm to join our pre-event reception planed just for you.</p> <p>* We are anticipating over 250 people attending our live event, so please arrive early for registration</p> <p>We especially look forward to seeing so many of you on Aug. 28th</p> <p>Sahar Kordahi  </p>

V<p>Join SCCAA and director Keegan Kuhn for a remarkable long over due documentary....</p> <p>This is the film that environmental organizations don't want you to see. "COWSPIRACY: The Sustainability Secret" is a groundbreaking feature-length environmental documentary following an intrepid filmmaker as he uncovers the most destructive industry facing the planet today, and investigates why the world's leading environmental organizations are too afraid to talk about it. This documentary will be as eye-opening as "Blackfish" and as inspiring as "An Inconvenient Truth." Trailer: <a href="http://cowspiracy.com/" class="linkified">http://cowspiracy.com/</a></p> <p>Speaker (to be announced) and Veggie Grill Raffles and Q &amp; A to follow the Movie!</p> <p>TICKETS HERE: <a href="https://www.tugg.com/go/x2otwo" class="linkified">https://www.tugg.com/go/x2otwo</a> NO ADMITTANCE WITHOUT A TICKET: $11.00</p> <p>This is a Tugg event! WE are working on a quota!<br/>Here is how it works...<br/>Once the tickets are available (Midnight July 25th), we need to reserve with a credit card (those of us that are able to go only), at that point your ticket will be in a pending status and on hold. Once we meet our quota of 79 people that have purchased...and only then, will the credit card be charged and the event is ON! If the quota is NOT met then the event is canceled and all pending transactions are canceled. That's it in a nutshell. For now please go to this link <a href="https://www.tugg.com/go/x2otwo" class="linkified">https://www.tugg.com/go/x2otwo</a> and "follow" so that you can be notified when the tickets are available for purchase. Please consider buying 2 or more for your family or friends or group. We must get this remarkable and long awaited view of animal activism in front of the public! You will be helping with that change.<br/>Presented by Santa Clara County Activists for Animals (SCCAA) Shining a light on animal cruelty.</p>

V<p><b>Experience Reiki</b> Reiki can help you to feel better! Reiki is a healing energy that flows in all of us This Meetup Group is Organized and Facilitated by four Reiki Masters; Jennifer, Ted, Rebecca and Jeff. They have made it possible for you to give and receive Reiki without having had the attunements. You do not want to miss this event. Reiki is a unique healing experience, rediscovered in Japan in the late 19th century but originally dating back at least to the days of the The Second Temple and of Jesus. This is not a structured training, but an opportunity for all to experience Reiki and for trained Reiki practitioners to practice by enjoying a Reiki exchange. <b> We start at 7:00 and we are usually complete by 9:00</b> $10.00 Suggested Donation&lt;/p&gt;</p>
